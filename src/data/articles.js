    abstract:
      "This research paper investigates the persistent literacy disparities in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal—three of India’s least literate states—and examines why national and state-level education policies have failed to bridge the gap. Using Kerala’s literacy model as a benchmark, the study identifies systemic barriers such as teacher shortages, poor school infrastructure, and socio-cultural inequality. A comparative analysis reveals that inclusive, community-driven, and digitally adaptive reforms are essential. The paper concludes with scalable policy recommendations to transform education systems and promote equitable literacy development across rural and tribal regions of India.",

    intro: [
      "Literacy in India displays significant regional imbalances, with Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal continuing to rank below the national average. Bihar, in particular, had the lowest literacy rate of just 61.8% as per the 2011 Census, while Kerala topped the chart at 93.9%, showcasing the stark contrasts in education quality and access. These disparities emphasize that universal education, though a constitutional right, remains inaccessible to many in India.",
      "Raising literacy rates is not merely a statistical endeavor—it directly impacts economic development, public health, gender equality, and social empowerment. Education reforms, therefore, must prioritize quality education for all, particularly in underdeveloped states. Kerala’s education model, widely known as the “Kerala model of literacy,” serves as a benchmark of how sustained public investment, social inclusion, and policy consistency can deliver transformative outcomes.",
      "This paper critically examines the systemic education challenges and policy gaps in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal that have impeded progress. Through comparative analysis with Kerala’s success, it proposes policy recommendations to improve educational infrastructure, boost teacher training, expand digital learning access, and address social barriers such as gender discrimination and language exclusion. The objective is to bridge the literacy gap in India by transitioning from policy rhetoric to tangible educational reform.",

        paragraphs: [
          "This research employs a comparative case study approach, examining Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal in parallel to identify common issues and unique contexts affecting literacy. We draw on a mix of quantitative data (census literacy rates, education surveys) and qualitative assessments (policy evaluations, case reports) to build a comprehensive picture. Historical policy documents and program reports from each state were reviewed to trace what interventions were tried and why they fell short. We benchmark these findings against Kerala's experience – analyzing Kerala's educational policies, budgets, and social initiatives over time as a model case.",
          "By comparing the target states with Kerala, we isolate which policy differences correspond to divergent literacy outcomes.We also use case comparisons within states (such as urban vs rural district data) to illustrate internal disparities and the micro-level impacts of policies. The methodology involves critique of past programs using secondary research: academic papers, government reports, and credible news sources provided evidence on implementation gaps and socio-economic factors. For instance, literacy survey data from the National Statistical Office (NSO) and District Information System of Education (DISE) highlight infrastructural and teacher availability issues.",
          "Policy impact is evaluated by looking at changes (or stagnation) in literacy rates over time and across demographic groups in each state.In essence, the study triangulates data from multiple sources – statistical records, policy analysis, and lessons from Kerala – to formulate evidence-based recommendations. This comparative, evaluative method allows us to go beyond anecdotal explanations and identify systemic factors that any successful literacy policy must address. The approach is interdisciplinary, considering educational, economic, and socio-cultural dimensions of literacy, to ensure that the recommended strategies are grounded in both data and contextual realities.",

        heading: "Systemic Challenges in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal",
        paragraphs: [
          "All three target states face interrelated systemic challenges that hinder literacy growth. Teacher shortages and quality gaps are a pervasive issue. Bihar and Odisha have struggled to staff remote rural schools with qualified teachers, leading to high pupil-teacher ratios and reliance on under-trained contract instructors. In Bihar, a massive recruitment of para-teachers in the 2000s filled vacant posts but often without adequate training or accountability, resulting in poor learning outcomes. By contrast, Kerala maintains a healthy student–teacher ratio (approximately 27:1, with 1.69 lakh teachers for 46 lakh students) and minimizes non-teaching duties for teachers.",
          "The shortage of trained teachers in Bihar, Odisha, and parts of West Bengal contributes to irregular classes and lower reading proficiency, undermining efforts to raise literacy. Infrastructure deficiencies in schools further exacerbate the problem. Many schools in these states lack basic facilities like libraries, toilets, and electricity, which impedes attendance and learning, especially for girls. In Bihar, as recently as 2016, a shockingly low 0.8% of schools had access to computers, nearly 30% had no library books, and 29.4% lacked any usable toilet.",
          "Odisha and West Bengal fare somewhat better but still have significant gaps in rural areas (for instance, as of 2011 over 39% of West Bengal’s districts had literacy below 70% indicating likely infrastructural and resource deficits in those regions). ",
          "Poor infrastructure not only hampers quality education but also discourages students from attending – a school without clean water, proper classrooms or digital access cannot retain children in the 21st century. Digital exclusion has emerged as a modern barrier. With education increasingly embracing technology, these states risk falling behind due to limited ICT resources in schools.",
          "The digital divide is evident: only 19.6% of schools in Bihar have computers, compared to 99.4% in Kerala. Rural schools in Odisha’s tribal belt and remote parts of West Bengal similarly lack internet connectivity and devices. This gap became painfully visible during recent periods of remote learning, where students in these states struggled to access online classes. ",
          "Kerala’s long-standing initiative introduced in early 2000s ensured most of its schools are equipped with computers and trained teachers, enabling smoother integration of digital learning. The absence of similar robust digital education programs in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal has left many of their youth digitally illiterate, limiting both their educational and economic opportunities.",
          "Socio-cultural barriers also play a major role in perpetuating low literacy. Deep-rooted poverty, gender discrimination, and social norms affect school participation. Bihar’s female literacy was only 51.5% in 2011 nearly 40 percentage points below Kerala’s female literacy reflecting how girls’ education has historically been devalued in parts of society. ",
          "Early marriage, domestic responsibilities, and safety concerns cause many girls to drop out before secondary level. Marginalized communities, such as scheduled castes and tribes, face additional hurdles. In Odisha’s tribal districts, the mainstream Odia-language curriculum alienated students who speak indigenous languages at home, contributing to high dropout rates. Malkangiri district, for example, has “abysmally low literacy” among its tribal population partly due to this linguistic barrier and the insurgency-related turmoil in the region",
          "Likewise, in rural West Bengal, children from minority communities or impoverished families may not get necessary support or may engage in child labor to supplement family income. These socio-cultural factors create an environment where illiteracy can persist across generations unless targeted interventions are made."

        heading: "Urban–Rural Disparities",
        paragraphs: [
          "A pronounced urban–rural divide underlies the literacy disparity in all three states. Urban centers usually enjoy better schools, higher qualified teachers, and more literate populations, whereas rural and remote areas lag far behind. In West Bengal, for instance, the capital city Kolkata boasts an 86.3% literacy rate on par with developed regions, while the rural district of Purulia struggles at roughly 64% literacy.",
          "Notably, female literacy in Purulia is barely about 51% illustrating how rural women are the most left behind. A similar contrast appears in Odisha: the literate, urbanized Bhubaneswar area (Khordha district) has over 90% literacy in its cities whereas a remote Adivasi-majority district like Malkangiri has overall literacy below 50% (and female literacy near 38%). ",
          "Such gaps are also evident within Bihar – Patna, the state capital, tops 87.8% literacy, while districts like Kishanganj remain around 61%, the lowest in the state. These cases illustrate how living in a metro versus a village can determine one’s educational fate. Urban areas benefit from historical concentration of schools (including private and missionary-run institutions), better infrastructure, and greater awareness of education’s benefits. In contrast, many rural hamlets in Bihar or Odisha until recently lacked a secondary school within reachable distance, and villages in flood-prone or hilly areas see teacher absenteeism and irregular schooling. ",
          "The urban–rural literacy gap also correlates with economic and social divides. Rural communities often have higher poverty rates and depend on child labor in agriculture, reducing school attendance.They are less exposed to the value of formal education if generations have lived without literate members. Additionally, urban elites and middle classes in these states may send children to private English-medium schools, whereas rural poor rely solely on often under-resourced government schools. ",
          "In Odisha, the rural literacy rate (70.2%) is far lower than urban literacy (85.7%), and rural female literacy is just 60.7%. Such disparities underscore that broad statewide averages mask internal inequities – geography and location critically influence literacy outcomes. Any policy solution must therefore explicitly focus on uplifting rural and underserved areas (like Purulia or Malkangiri) and not just the state as a whole"

        heading: "Failed Policies",
        paragraphs: [
          "Historical efforts to improve education in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal have often fallen short due to flawed design or execution. Analyzing these failures is vital to avoid repeating mistakes. National programs like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) – launched in 2001 to universalize elementary education – did increase school enrolment but had varying impacts across states, with the weakest gains in already lagging states. In regions of Bihar and Odisha, SSA led to more schools on paper but not necessarily to effective learning, partly because hiring untrained para-teachers became a quick fix to meet enrollment targets without ensuring quality. Similarly, the National Literacy Mission (including the Saakshar Bharat adult literacy campaign of 2009-2018) made only a dent in adult illiteracy.",

        heading: "The Urban-Rural Divides Should Also Dimish",
        paragraphs: [
          "As rural schools get more resources and community engagement, rural literacy rates will rise faster, reducing the disparity. For instance, the gap between Kolkata and districts like Purulia may shrink as rural West Bengal sees new educational investments and campaigns. Beyond the numbers, the qualitative impact will be far-reaching. A literate populace is better equipped to participate in the economy – we can expect improved workforce skills and productivity in these states, attracting more investments and jobs.",
          "Literacy is linked to health and social outcomes: newly literate adults (especially women) are more likely to seek healthcare, practice better hygiene, and have smaller, healthier families. Over time, higher literacy can reduce poverty and dependence on manual, unskilled labor as more youth attain higher education and diverse employment. Socially, increased literacy fosters empowerment and democratic participation",
          "We may see higher voter turnout, more informed civic discourse, and communities better able to demand accountability from officials when people can read news and official information. As one analysis noted, communities with high literacy tend to have greater economic diversification and enhanced social capital meaning people can pursue varied occupations and collectively address their issues more effectively. ",
          "In Bihar’s context, a literacy boost could help break the feudal and caste-based barriers, as education opens opportunities across social lines. In Odisha’s tribal regions, functional literacy combined with mother-tongue education can preserve cultural identity while integrating tribes into the broader economy and polity on their own terms. In West Bengal, higher literacy in backward pockets like the Sundarbans or border districts would contribute to human development and reduce regional imbalances. ",
          "Bihar was a focus of Saakshar Bharat, and while it claimed to impart basic literacy to millions of adults, the lack of post-literacy follow-up meant many neo-literates relapsed into illiteracy. The varying success of these central schemes highlights a pattern: one-size-fits-all policies failed to account for local realities like language differences, poverty, or administrative capacity in these states. Looking at state-specific policies, Bihar’s attempt at educational reform in the mid-2000s is a telling example. The state undertook a massive drive to recruit over 100,000 teachers on contract (locally called Shiksha Mitras or Niyojit teachers) to fill vacancies in primary schools. ",
          "While this addressed the numerical shortage (bringing down student-teacher ratios somewhat), it introduced new problems: many recruits lacked proper qualifications or training, were paid low stipends, and had little incentive or accountability. The result was that classroom instruction quality remained poor – evident from surveys that showed Bihar’s children lagging in reading and arithmetic despite attending school. ",
          "A notorious incident in 2015, where images of mass cheating in Bihar’s board examinations went viral, underscored systemic dysfunction – students resorted to unscrupulous means to pass exams, reflecting a failure of foundational teaching and ethical inculcation. This implementation gap – having schools and teachers in name but not in substance – has haunted Bihar’s educational initiatives. ",
          "In Odisha, one challenge has been delivering education to its diverse tribal populations. The state launched programs like “Satya Bahama” hostels and bilingual primers to encourage tribal children to attend school, but for years these remained limited in scope. Until recently, curricula did not adequately incorporate tribal languages, causing alienation. The Multilingual Education (MLE) program started in 2007 in Malkangiri is a positive step, teaching young children in their mother tongue and gradually transitioning to Odia and English. However, such innovations took a long time to scale up. ",
          "Odisha’s literacy efforts also suffered from budgetary constraints – education spending as a share of total budget was relatively low in the 1990s and 2000s compared to needs. Frequent natural disasters (cyclones, floods) diverted attention and funds, slowing school infrastructure development in backward districts. The government’s “School & Mass Education” department tried initiatives like recruiting Sikshya Sahayaks (contract teachers) and opening Navodaya residential schools for talented rural students, but uneven monitoring led to variable outcomes. ",
          "As a result, pockets of the state (notably the eight most backward districts of KBK region – Kalahandi, Bolangir, Koraput, including Malkangiri and Nabarangpur) remained severely educationally deprived. Odisha’s policies often looked good on paper but faltered at the last mile – for example, funds for school construction or girls’ scholarships sometimes lapsed due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, leaving targets unmet. ",
          "West Bengal has a long history of education movements yet also faces its own policy missteps. In the Left Front regime (1977–2011), the state emphasized basic education through programs like the Shishu Shiksha Kendra (SSK) and Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra (MSK) – community-run primary and upper-primary schools in rural areas. While SSKs did expand schooling access in remote villages, they were staffed by para-teachers with minimal training and low salaries, which translated to modest learning outcomes. ",
          "The transition rates from SSKs to formal high schools were not as high as hoped, indicating that many children, especially girls and those from poor families, did not continue beyond elementary levels. West Bengal also struggled with educational quality in government schools: political interference in teacher transfers and a lack of English education in earlier decades prompted many families (even lower-income ones) to switch to private schools, leaving public schools under-resourced. ",
          "Additionally, certain districts with high minority (Muslim) populations, like Murshidabad or Uttar Dinajpur, had very low literacy (around 60%). Policies failed here because they did not address community-specific barriers – e.g. no special drive to educate first-generation learners in these communities or to convince parents of the long-term value of schooling. It wasn’t until the 2010s that schemes like Kanyashree Prakalpa (a conditional cash transfer to keep adolescent girls in school) were introduced, and these have shown some success. ",
          "But prior to that, gender and socio-economic neglect in policy meant many girls married early or many boys dropped out to work, especially in rural West Bengal. Across all three states, a recurring theme in policy failure is the gap between intent and implementation. Budgets were often insufficient – education expenditure per student in these poorer states lagged far behind that in Kerala, where successive governments prioritize funding for schools",
          "Even when funds were allocated, they sometimes did not reach the school level due to leakages or administrative red tape. Moreover, reforms often did not tackle root causes: for example, providing a school building is futile if social norms prevent girls from attending, or if malnourished children cannot concentrate in class. The past policies in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal often took a siloed approach (focusing on inputs like schools or teachers in isolation) rather than a holistic one. ",
          "The result was that marginalized groups – rural populations, women, tribal communities – gained literacy at a glacial pace, leaving these states still trailing in basic education even after India as a whole made strides. These lessons from failed or inadequate policies inform the need for a more comprehensive, Kerala-inspired strategy moving forward.",

          " Invest heavily in recruiting and training qualified teachers, especially in underserved rural and tribal areas. Each state should set up local teacher education institutes and continuous development programs to ensure teachers meet competency standards. Kerala's experience shows the value of a robust teacher–student ratio and freeing teachers from non-academic duties. Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal must similarly professionalize teaching: regularize or replace under-qualified contract teachers with well-trained educators, provide incentives for skilled teachers to serve in remote areas (such as housing or salary uplifts), and enforce accountability for attendance and performance. A cadre of community-based female educators should be developed to reach girls in conservative rural communities, thereby tackling gender disparities in literacy at the grassroots.",

This includes building adequate classrooms, separate functional toilets for girls and boys, clean drinking water facilities, electricity, and libraries in every public school. The contrast with Kerala – where virtually all schools have these basics – is stark; for example, Bihar must urgently address situations where nearly one-third of schools lack toilets or libraries.",
          "All three states should earmark dedicated capital funds in their budgets for school infrastructure, possibly leveraging central schemes and public-private partnerships. Monitoring mechanisms (with community oversight) should ensure construction quality and timely completion. Improving infrastructure will particularly help retain girls (who often drop out due to lack of toilets or safety) and create a more conducive learning environment. Each upgraded school can become a hub for literacy in its village, attracting out-of-school children and adult learners for evening classes as well.",

          "Bridge the digital divide by providing modern learning tools in government schools. Following Kerala’s lead in ICT education, Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal should equip schools with computers, affordable tablets, and internet connectivity. A phased plan can aim for all secondary schools to have computer labs and trained ICT instructors within a few years, and primary schools at least some digital learning device access. Governments could collaborate with initiatives like NDLM (National Digital Literacy Mission) to train both students and teachers in basic digital skills. ",
          "Additionally, utilize educational broadcasting and mobile technology to reach learners in remote locations – e.g., Odisha could expand radio lessons in tribal languages or West Bengal could use smartphone apps with Bengali educational content for rural youth. By democratizing access to digital resources ensure continuity of education during disruptions (as seen during pandemic lockdowns). Digital inclusion efforts must also be paired with electricity access (solar panels in off-grid schools, for instance) so that technology is reliable. These investments will produce a generation of digitally literate young people, improving both their learning outcomes and employability in the modern economy."

Odisha has pioneered multilingual education in places like Malkangiri – teaching tribal children first in their native tongues, then bridging to Odia and English. This model should be expanded and replicated in other tribal-dominated areas of Odisha and West Bengal (which has Santhali, Oraon and other tribal groups), as well as among minority-language communities in Bihar (such as Urdu speakers in certain districts). ",
          "Teaching children in a familiar language in early grades improves comprehension and prevents them from dropping out in frustration. Alongside, special training for teachers on inclusive education is needed – covering pedagogies for first-generation learners, children with disabilities, and those from socially disadvantaged groups. ",
          "Kerala’s near-universal literacy was achieved not just through formal schooling but also through adult education and alternative learning centers that brought historically excluded groups (like lower castes and women) into the fold of literacy. Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal should reinvigorate adult literacy missions and link them with livelihood skills, focusing on women and older youth who missed formal schooling. Community learning centers in every panchayat (village council) could serve as venues for evening classes, vocational training, and reading rooms, fostering a culture of learning beyond school age."

          "Borrowing from Kerala’s famous mass literacy campaigns, the target states should galvanize a social movement for literacy. Kerala’s 1989–90 Total Literacy Campaign, which mobilized thousands of volunteers and community groups, was key to its success. Similar campaigns can be launched in Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal with the help of local NGOs, youth clubs, women’s self-help groups (e.g. Bihar’s Jeevika groups), and Panchayati Raj institutions. These campaigns would involve door-to-door surveys to identify illiterate youth and adults, followed by volunteer-taught classes and reading circles. ",
          "“Each one teaches one” initiatives, where literate individuals tutor an illiterate neighbor, can create a ripple effect. Community engagement is also critical for addressing socio-cultural resistance – for example, involving village elders and religious leaders to champion girls’ education and dispel fears or superstitions that keep children out of school. By making literacy a collective mission – celebrated with local incentives (like literacy certificates, public recognition for villages that become fully literate) – the states can transform attitudes. The school should be seen as a community asset; forming Village Education Committees that include parents can improve accountability. When communities take ownership of education outcomes, they can help monitor teacher attendance, raise funds for school needs, and ensure every child is enrolled and learning."

        paragraphs: [
          "A critical lesson from Kerala is the sustained political commitment to education financing and decentralization of administration. The target states must commit to raising their education budgets – for instance, setting a goal to spend a significant percentage of state GDP (or state budget) on education, inching closer to Kerala’s per-capita education expenditure. This could involve tough choices like reallocating resources from less impactful areas to schooling, but the returns in human capital will be high. In addition, empowering local governments (district or block level) with funds and decision-making authority for education can improve responsiveness. ",
          "Kerala’s decentralization in the 1990s allowed local bodies to tailor solutions for their schools. Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal can establish district education councils that prepare localized plans: one district might prioritize girls’ hostels to address female dropout, while another focuses on recruiting teachers in a particular subject shortage. Transparent budgeting and social audits should be enforced so that money reaches schools – for instance, each school’s grant and expenditures should be public information, enabling communities to audit their use. ",
          "International development funds or corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions can also be tapped for one-time capital surges (like building digital infrastructure or model schools) under state supervision. By planning education investments over a 10-15 year horizon with protected funding streams, these states can avoid the common pitfall of ad-hoc, fluctuating support that derails reforms."

          "Finally, all strategies must be overlaid with a focus on gender equity and social inclusion. This means setting specific targets to reduce the male-female literacy gap and literacy gaps for scheduled castes and tribes. Initiatives like West Bengal’s Kanyashree (scholarships to keep girls in school) should be expanded and emulated in Bihar and Odisha, alongside efforts to make schools safer and more girl-friendly (e.g. recruiting more female teachers, providing menstrual hygiene facilities). Similarly, provide bridge courses and second-chance schooling for married adolescents or young mothers who want to study later. Educational outreach in hamlets of the poorest communities – Dalits in Bihar, adivasis in Odisha, minority groups in West Bengal – should be intensified via dedicated facilitators. ",
          "Kerala’s success in minimizing social disparities (with literacy rates above 90% for both men and women, and small rural-urban gaps) illustrates that when the most disadvantaged are reached, overall literacy soars. Thus, policies should be regularly evaluated through an equity lens: e.g., are female literacy rates improving year-on-year? Is the gap between a tribal block and the state average closing? Tying funding and administrative rewards to these metrics can incentivize officials to focus on inclusive progress. In sum, making education truly universal will require not just generic improvements but targeted interventions to uplift those historically left behind.",
          "By implementing these multi-pronged recommendations – improved teaching, better infrastructure, digital access, inclusive content, community mobilization, stable funding, and equity focus – Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal can replicate and even build upon Kerala’s model. The aim is to convert policy into practice on the ground, so that a child in Malkangiri or Purulia today receives an education as empowering as one in urban Kerala. Each recommendation reinforces the others; together they form a holistic plan to break the cycle of illiteracy."

    conclusion: [
      "If the recommended reforms are pursued with political will and community support, the long-term outcomes could be transformative for Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal. Within a decade, these states can expect a substantial jump in literacy rates – moving from the current ranges (60–76%) closer to the national average and beyond. Bihar, for example, which improved from 47% in 2001 to 64% in 2011 and ~71% by 2017, could accelerate its literacy growth to reach the 80–85% range by the next census through aggressive adult education and improved schooling. Odisha and West Bengal, currently in the 70s, could push into the high 80s, nearing Kerala’s achievements, if they systematically implement the Kerala-style interventions.",
      "Crucially, the gender gap in literacy is expected to narrow significantly. With focused female education programs, one would anticipate female literacy in Bihar (around 60% in 2017) to catch up to male literacy (around 80%) over time, emulating Kerala’s near parity (just 4 percentage point difference between sexes).",
      "One can project that in the next 15–20 years, with sustained effort, Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal will no longer be tagged as “least literate” but rather as success stories of turnaround. The literacy rate could realistically approach 90% or above by 2040, creating near-universal literacy societies. The expected outcomes are self-reinforcing: as literacy rises, it creates a virtuous cycle – literate parents ensure their children are educated, communities demand better schooling, and educated citizens contribute more to the economy, providing more resources for education. ",
      "In essence, the reforms would translate policy into practice effectively, making “Education for All” a reality in even the hardest-to-reach corners of these states. The journey will require persistent commitment, but the payoff is a future where all citizens of Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal can read, write, and contribute their talents to the nation’s progress, following in the footsteps of Kerala’s enlightened society.

    intro: [
      "“In a country where over 90% of working women are in the informal sector, can a law designed for the formal workforce bring real change?” This paradox frames the critical examination of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 — a law that extended maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks and mandated crèche facilities in workplaces with more than 50 employees, in the hope of improving maternal health and women’s labor retention. This article explores the Act’s impact on women’s workforce participation in India between 2014 and 2024, a period marked by policy reform, economic shifts, and a global pandemic. The discussion provides a holistic overview of legislative intent, national labor trends, employer responses, regional disparities, and psychological challenges faced by mothers. Key themes include the mismatch between formal-sector policy and informal-sector reality, the rise in rural women’s workforce participation driven more by economic necessity than legal protection, and the cost burdens faced by employers, especially SMEs. The article is structured around five major sections — beginning with legal and historical background, followed by labor market trends, disparities in implementation, employer and SME reactions, and psychological return-to-work dynamics. These sections together reveal that while the Act is a necessary step toward inclusive labor reform, it remains insufficient in scope and accessibility. The topic holds significance not only for legal and economic scholars but also for policymakers and advocates of gender equity, as it highlights how structural inequality persists despite well-intentioned legislation and underscores the need for broader, more inclusive interventions. It also offers insights into future policy directions for inclusive maternal labor protections.",

        heading: "Background and Literature Review",
        paragraphs: [
          "Historically, India's female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) has been among the lowest globally, stagnating around 23–25% before 2017 despite rapid economic growth and increasing educational attainment among women (World Bank, 2023). This paradox of low participation amidst progress raised significant policy concerns. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, was introduced as a corrective measure to arrest declining female workforce engagement and improve post-childbirth employment retention. The law extended paid maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks and mandated workplace crèche facilities, aligning with global health recommendations.",
          "However, its reach was limited: it applied only to establishments with more than ten employees and required 80 days of prior work, excluding over 90% of Indian women engaged in informal sectors such as agriculture, domestic work, and unregistered enterprises (ILO, 2021). Academic and policy literature has highlighted both the progressive intent and the practical shortcomings of the amendment. On one hand, it promotes better maternal and child health outcomes in line with WHO guidelines (Strang & Broeks, 2016); on the other, the financial burden placed entirely on employers has raised concerns about unintended hiring biases against women, particularly in childbearing age groups (Dewan & Bhasin, 2020).",
          "Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which often lack formal HR systems and operate on tight margins, are disproportionately affected. Moreover, weak enforcement mechanisms and low awareness levels in rural areas further limit the Act's implementation. These structural gaps call for a more inclusive and sustainable policy approach that extends protection beyond the formal sector and supports both employers and employees in balancing economic and caregiving responsibilities.",

        heading: "Trends in Women's Labor Force Participation (2014–2024)",
        paragraphs: [
          "Data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and the World Bank reveal a complex and uneven trajectory of women's workforce participation in India over the past decade. In 2017–18, India's female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) stood at a modest 23.3%, already one of the lowest globally. This stagnated until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when lockdowns and economic disruptions led to a dramatic decline, pushing FLFPR to a historic low of 16.1% (World Bank, 2021). However, by 2023–24, FLFPR showed a sharp recovery, rising to approximately 42%, driven largely by rural women's increased economic activity.",
          "Despite this promising headline figure, deeper disparities emerge when disaggregated by geography. Rural FLFPR rose from 24.6% in 2017 to a significant 47.6% in 2023–24, while urban FLFPR remained largely stagnant, growing only marginally to 28–30%. This rural surge is attributed less to formal sector employment or maternity-related policies and more to economic necessity, subsistence activities, and government programs such as MGNREGA, livelihood missions, and Self-Help Group (SHG) initiatives. Many rural women engaged in unpaid family labor, piece-rate work, or informal enterprises, which are excluded from most labor protections, including the Maternity Benefit Act.",
          "Urban women, in contrast, face persistent structural barriers: lack of affordable and accessible childcare, rigid job structures, high commuting times, and workplace biases continue to suppress their labor market re-entry. A 2023 NITI Aayog study indicated that nearly 40% of urban women who leave work post-childbirth find it difficult to return within the first two years. Employer hesitancy, particularly in SMEs and private firms, further compounds this issue.",
          "Sectorally, women's participation in agriculture has increased significantly—from 57% in 2017–18 to 64.4% in 2023–24—reflecting growing reliance on informal and unpaid labor rather than formal job growth. Conversely, regular salaried employment among mothers remains low. Only about 11% of mothers with infants held formal, salaried positions, and 48% reportedly exited the workforce within four months of returning from maternity leave, underscoring poor retention and inadequate workplace support.",
          "This pattern reflects the persistent 'motherhood penalty,' where women face slower career growth, wage stagnation, and reduced hiring opportunities post-childbirth. A 2022 study highlighted a 22% drop in interview callbacks for women of childbearing age, particularly in IT and SME sectors. These trends affirm that without universal childcare solutions, flexible work policies, and shared parental leave, India's female workforce will continue to face high attrition and systemic disadvantage after maternity.",

        heading: "Regional and Sectoral Disparities",
        paragraphs: [
          "The impact of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, varies significantly across regions and sectors in India, revealing deep-rooted structural disparities. Southern states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have demonstrated relatively stronger implementation of the Act. These states benefit from higher levels of female literacy, greater institutional capacity, and pre-existing maternal welfare schemes. Tamil Nadu, for instance, has complemented the central Act with state-funded maternal assistance programs such as the Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme, which has improved both awareness and benefit uptake. Effective labor inspection systems and better enforcement mechanisms in these states have further enhanced compliance among employers.",
          "In contrast, northern and eastern states like Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh lag in both awareness and implementation. These regions have higher concentrations of informal employment, weak administrative infrastructure, and limited access to health and welfare programs. Consequently, women working in these areas, particularly in rural settings, are far less likely to receive any maternity-related benefits. Despite the increasing participation of rural women in the labor force post-2020, over 90% remain excluded from the Maternity Benefit Act's provisions due to their employment in unorganized sectors such as agriculture, domestic work, and cottage industries.",
          "The formal-sector bias of the Act results in a significant policy blind spot, denying coverage to the vast majority of India's working women. Sectoral disparities mirror this trend. The organized sector, which employs less than 10% of India's female workforce, is the primary domain where the Act holds legal authority. Within this sector, compliance is more feasible due to better resources and administrative structures. However, small and medium enterprises (SMEs)—even those legally covered—struggle to comply due to financial and logistical constraints.",
          "Faced with the costs of six months of paid leave and crèche facilities, many SMEs choose to limit female hiring or shift toward male-dominated workforces, inadvertently reinforcing gender exclusion. In the unorganized sector, the Act is virtually non-functional, leaving a vast coverage gap and deepening inequalities between formal and informal employment outcomes. To bridge this divide, a hybrid policy approach has been increasingly advocated. Integrating the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) with statutory maternity benefits, providing government subsidies to SMEs, and expanding social safety nets can help improve accessibility and equity. Shared cost responsibilities between the state and employers would ease financial burdens and encourage wider compliance. Without such reforms, the Maternity Benefit Act risks benefiting only a narrow, urban, salaried class, leaving behind the majority of Indian women it was designed to protect.",

        heading: "Employer Responses and Return-to-Work Challenges",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, while progressive in intent, introduced several unintended financial and operational challenges for employers, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which employ a substantial portion of India's workforce. SMEs, typically defined as businesses with fewer than 250 employees, form the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing around 30% to the GDP and generating significant employment, especially for women. However, these businesses often function with limited financial buffers, informal processes, and minimal human resources infrastructure, making full compliance with the Act difficult.",
          "Under the amended law, employers are obligated to provide six months of fully paid maternity leave to eligible women employees, without any state subsidy or cost-sharing arrangement. For SMEs, this translates into a dual burden: direct costs such as continued salary payments during the leave period, and indirect costs associated with hiring and training temporary replacements, disrupted workflows, and reduced productivity. In many cases, businesses also face legal ambiguity or lack guidance on how to implement crèche facilities, further complicating compliance.",
          "In the absence of a government compensation mechanism, many SMEs have turned to workaround strategies. These include outsourcing work temporarily, hiring contract-based staff, reallocating tasks among existing employees, or, more concerningly, avoiding the hiring of women altogether, particularly those in their childbearing years. Surveys and interviews with business owners reveal growing concerns about return-to-work reliability, continuity in projects, and long-term financial sustainability. Some employers have even described the policy as 'well-intentioned but impractical,' particularly for enterprises in the manufacturing and services sectors where staffing continuity is critical.",
          "Despite these concerns, a few progressive SMEs have adopted flexible work arrangements, part-time return options, or partial wage-sharing models to support female employees. However, such practices remain limited and uneven, largely due to low legal literacy, the absence of dedicated HR personnel, and a lack of incentives to promote inclusive hiring. Compared to countries like the United Kingdom or Canada, where the state shares a substantial portion of maternity benefits, India's employer-pays-all model creates a structural disincentive for gender-equitable hiring in the private sector. To ensure that maternity protections do not become a barrier to women's employment, India must rethink its approach—offering financial incentives, tax deductions, or reimbursements for SMEs and creating awareness campaigns on gender-sensitive labor practices. Without addressing these economic realities, the Act risks reinforcing gender gaps in employment rather than closing them.",

        heading: "Psychological Aspects and Return-to-Work Realities",
        paragraphs: [
          "Beyond legal and economic dimensions, maternity involves profound psychological and emotional transitions that significantly influence women's ability to return to work. Pregnancy and the postpartum period bring intense hormonal shifts, physical exhaustion, and identity changes as women adjust to motherhood. These transitions often create psychological vulnerability, particularly in the first six months after childbirth. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10–15% of new mothers in low- and middle-income countries experience postpartum depression, while anxiety disorders affect an additional 8–10%.",
          "Studies have linked short maternity leave, lack of workplace support, and pressure to return to work early with higher risks of depression, burnout, and poor job retention. Many mothers report symptoms such as fatigue, breast pain, emotional exhaustion, and reduced concentration when they return to work prematurely (Dagher et al., 2014). In India, nearly 30% of new mothers cite domestic responsibilities and inflexible work conditions as reasons for exiting the workforce within a year of childbirth (India Today, 2025). This loss is not just personal—it affects economic productivity and workplace diversity. Psychological barriers like separation anxiety, body image issues, and guilt for not fulfilling perceived maternal or professional roles further complicate re-entry.",
          "Return-to-work outcomes improve significantly when women have access to social support, workplace accommodations, flexible scheduling, and mental health care (Franzoi et al., 2024). India's six-month maternity leave aligns with WHO's exclusive breastfeeding guidelines, offering potential benefits for both maternal and infant health, yet implementation gaps persist. A major challenge remains the 'maternity penalty'—a form of bias where women face reduced opportunities for promotions, raises, or re-employment after childbirth. Studies report a 22% drop in interview callbacks for women in their childbearing years, especially in sectors like IT and SMEs (Das & Ghosh, 2020).",
          "Mental health support is still under-recognized in Indian workplaces, with few employers offering postpartum counseling or reintegration assistance. For maternity policies to truly succeed, organizations must go beyond compliance and foster a culture of empathy, flexibility, and psychological safety. Integrating maternal mental health screening, family-friendly HR policies, and awareness campaigns can help reduce attrition, promote well-being, and create a more equitable work environment. Without addressing these invisible yet impactful psychological barriers, even the most progressive legal reforms risk leaving working mothers behind.",

      {
        heading: "Additional Insights",
        paragraphs: [
          "One of the most significant criticisms of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 is its employer-centric funding model, which places the entire financial burden of paid maternity leave on private businesses, without any state support or subsidy. This model stands in sharp contrast to international best practices. In countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, and several members of the OECD, maternity leave costs are partially or fully subsidized by the government through social insurance schemes, public funds, or payroll contributions. For example, in Canada, maternity and parental benefits are covered under the Employment Insurance (EI) system, ensuring that employers are not disincentivized from hiring women of reproductive age. Similarly, in the UK, employers can recover 92–103% of statutory maternity pay from the government, depending on their size (OECD, 2022).",
          "In India, however, the absence of such cost-sharing mechanisms creates structural disincentives, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which operate on thin margins and often lack the administrative capacity to manage long leave periods. A 2022 All India Manufacturers' Organisation (AIMO) survey found that over 35% of SMEs considered avoiding hiring women in childbearing age groups due to financial and operational concerns related to maternity leave. Integrating existing schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)—which currently offers conditional cash transfers of Rs. 5,000 for the first live birth—with the statutory maternity benefit framework could help extend support to women in informal sectors and reduce the exclusive burden on employers.",
          "However, PMMVY coverage remains limited; according to NFHS-5 (2019–21), only 28% of eligible women received full maternity benefits, highlighting significant gaps in awareness, access, and implementation. Beyond economic costs, the motherhood penalty continues to disadvantage women professionally. A study by Das & Ghosh (2020) reported a 22% decline in interview callbacks for women in the 25–35 age range, especially in urban service sectors like IT, banking, and education. This bias, both overt and subtle, affects long-term career progression, wage growth, and retention. To overcome these barriers, policy reforms must include government-funded reimbursements, tax incentives for compliant employers, mandatory paternity leave, and investment in subsidized, quality childcare infrastructure. Such measures would not only alleviate the financial burden on businesses but also foster a more gender-equitable labor market by challenging norms that place childcare solely on women.",
        ],
      },
    ],
    conclusion: [
      "While the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 marked a vital step in recognizing and legislating for the needs of working mothers, its practical benefits remain largely confined to a small segment of the workforce—women employed in the formal sector. For the vast majority of Indian women engaged in informal employment, the law has had little to no impact. Moreover, although female workforce participation has shown a notable rise since 2020, especially in rural areas where it reached 47.6% by 2023–24, this increase appears more rooted in economic compulsion and the expansion of informal or subsistence-level employment than in the protective effects of maternity legislation. The pandemic, while disruptive, also pushed many women into low-paying or precarious work to support household incomes. These developments underscore the limited scope of the Act and the urgent need for structural reforms that are both inclusive and sustainable.",
      "India must adopt a multi-pronged strategy that addresses systemic barriers across economic, social, and institutional domains to achieve a broader and more meaningful impact. First, cost-sharing frameworks are essential: offering state-funded maternity leave reimbursements or tax incentives, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), can ease the financial burden and encourage the hiring and retention of women. Second, there is a pressing need to expand affordable and accessible childcare infrastructure, particularly through integrated community-based crèches under the ICDS or in partnership with private and civil society organizations. Third, policy convergence is crucial; maternity benefits should be aligned with schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) and relevant labor codes to ensure that women in informal and unorganized sectors are not left behind. Fourth, promoting flexible work arrangements and shared parental responsibilities, including paternity leave, can reduce the motherhood penalty and support women’s smoother re-entry into the workforce. Finally, robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms must be implemented to track compliance and effectiveness, using data from PLFS, ESIC, or labor inspections.",
      "Ultimately, maternity support must evolve from being a limited legal entitlement to a comprehensive framework that protects, empowers, and uplifts all working women in India, regardless of their sector, geography, or socioeconomic status. Only through such an integrated approach can India bridge the gender gap in workforce participation and foster a more inclusive, equitable labor market.",

    intro: [
      "For generations, the dichotomy between idealism and realism has provided a thesis, an antithesis, and then, at the end, a pragmatic synthesis. Its genesis can be traced back to both traditional Indian philosophers and ancient Greek thinkers, from Chanakya’s eclectic approach towards statism to Shakespeare’s use of the word “Machiavellian” as an adjective. The constant struggle between both schools of thought has formed the foundation for almost every social science, but dominantly that of political science and international relations. The antagonism between “what should be” and “what ought to be” entered the realm of international relations as an academic theoretical practice in the early 20th century. Since then, global politics has never maintained an absolute equilibrium; it has either an inclination towards the left or right, liberal institutionalism or realism. In the year 2024, almost every major democracy witnessed national elections, and the mandate in countries like America, Germany, and even India is signaling a shift towards the rise of the global right. As the Trump administration took charge, every nation is pondering over the question: whether liberal institutionalism is still relevant in this decade or are we back to the old pre-Cold War era realism? From Trump’s tariff and comments on countries like Greenland and Canada to China’s “cheque cum debt” diplomacy in our region to the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars and the recent Indo-Pak crisis, all these events have triggered a need for a curious academic interpretation of the contemporary global situations.",

          "Conceptual Understanding of Realism, Neo-Realism, Liberalism and Neo-Liberal Institutionalism",
        paragraphs: [
          "Realism views international interactions, which themselves are colossal and bewilderingly complex, from the perspectives of an intense political struggle for power. The theory perceives individuals and states as primarily selfish and power-seeking. The states are also perceived as unitary actors in the pursuit of their national interest, which unavoidably traps them into an anarchical situation. As such, the Realists view the international system, which itself constitutes a set of rules structured according to some established rules and patterns of international interactions, as anarchical in nature; and consequently, the need for the management of insecurity, which arises out of the anarchical system.",
          "The Realists are known advocates of rationality in decision-making and reliance primarily on balance of power and deterrence to keep the international system intact and as non-threatening as possible. According to Bell, 'Realism is a set of related theories of international relations that emphasizes the role of the state, national interest, and military power in world politics.' Realism, just like any other theory, is a construct of a variety of dispositions by various philosophers, both classical and contemporary. As such, it is widely divided into two major categories, i.e., Classical Realism and a series of contemporary reinterpretations of the theory, the most popular among which is Structural Realism.",
          "However, in 1979, a new impetus was given to the theory by the rise of a popular reinterpretation of Realism termed Structural or Neo-Realism, championed and delineated by Kenneth Waltz. Generally, the neo-realists see the international system structure as the most important unit to study rather than the individual (state), who is labelled to be selfish and power seeking. This structure, the neo-realists argued, is determined by the ordering principle, viz., the absence of overarching authority, and the distribution of capabilities among states.",
          "On the other hand, institutionalism, or neo-liberal constitutionalism, is more of a later and pragmatic manifestation of a broader political theory called liberalism, and the very core of this ideology in IR is cooperation between states, which is achieved through international institutions such as the U.N., QUAD, or SAARC. As one of the oldest political philosophies, liberalism has its roots in the abstract concept of idealism. From John Locke's 'life, liberty, and property' to Kantian's human beings as 'end in itself' to Bentham's utilitarian principle of 'greatest happiness of the greatest number,' liberalism has dominated the philosophical sphere from the century and continues to do so to this very day.",
          "In contrast to realism, which rose as a criticism of liberalism during the late 19th century, liberals propagate few core principles. They argue that human beings are perfectible and primary actors are international actors; relations between states can be based on cooperation rather than confrontation, and liberals also give less importance to military than to socio-economic, environmental, and technological factors. Using the theory of Locke, liberals argue that state interests are both 'self-regarding and other-regarding,' i.e., state interests are dynamic as they keep aligning with the ever-changing human needs. But as time progressed post-WW2, even the most optimistic liberals started becoming skeptical towards human nature, giving rise to neo-liberalism.",

        paragraphs: [
          "The foundations of this school of thought can be traced back from the period of antiquity to the modern period with the works of the renowned realists of the world. From Kautilya and Sun Tzu in the Eastern world to Thucydides and Machiavelli in the Western world. As remarked by Roger Boesche, 'Kautilya is actually the first great political realist,' and his Arthashastra (4th century BCE) has provided the base for Indian realism with his groundbreaking theories on political realism.",
          "He introduced the Saptanga theory, where he emphasized the culmination off seven factors (prakritis) constituting the power of the state. His Mandala theory identified the relations of a kingdom with its neighbors to identify who is a friend or enemy. He has created the base of the present foreign policies with the four elements (or four circles): Vijishu (king), Ari (the immediate neighbor), Udasina (neutral neighbor), and Madhyama (another neutral neighbor).",
          "Early conceptual foundations were established by thinkers like Immanuel Kant, who argued in his article Perpetual Peace (1795) that a federation of states was required to maintain peace through the rule of law and republican governance (Kant, 1795/2006). Hugo Grotius and Jean-Jacques Rousseau also highlighted the importance of norms and the rule of law in controlling international affairs. However, the advent of legal positivism and the first International organizations, such as the Universal Postal Union (1874) and the International Telegraph Union (1865), which were forerunners of contemporary IOs, marked the formal emergence of the institutionalist tradition in the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
          "A major turning point that led to a boom in international institutional thought was World War I. Woodrow Wilson, the president of the United States, promoted the notion that liberal institutional arrangements could facilitate international cooperation. The League of Nations, created in 1920 by the Treaty of Versailles, was the realization of his vision.",

          "Institutionalism posits that international institutions and legal norms facilitate cooperation among states, even in an anarchic international system. The UN Charter is a cornerstone document that encapsulates institutionalist principles: Article 1(1): Outlines the UN's purpose to maintain international peace and security through collective measures. Article 1(3): Emphasizes international cooperation in solving global issues and promoting human rights. Article 55(c): Advocates for universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.",
          "Realism centers on the notion that states operate in an anarchic international system, prioritizing national interests and security. While seemingly at odds with institutionalism, certain UN Charter provisions acknowledge the realist perspective: Article 2(4): Prohibits the threat or use of force, yet reflects recognition of power dynamics. Article 51: Affirms the right of individual or collective self-defense.",

For instance, while the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) promises to boost intra-African trade, its implementation has been slow due to individual states reluctance to open markets or relinquish control.",

This shift has been expedited by President Trump's return to office, as his administration has prioritized narrowly defined national interests over international institutional commitments. More than just economic protectionism, the imposition of historic 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and higher duties on Chinese goods represents a fundamental revaluation of America's place in the world.",
          "This change is significant because it originates from the country that created the liberal order after the war. For many years, American institutions and power promoted stability and furthered American objectives. The present retreat implies that these institutions no longer support America's fundamental national interests or, worse, that they limit rather than increase American power.",

    intro: [
      "The globe is currently experiencing a paradigm shift, towards decarbonization of the energy matrix, and hydrogen, as energy vector, has an opportunity in various areas including industrial application processes, power, and transportation. Nevertheless, hydrogen is not a clean fuel by its nature, and its environmental impact would depend radically on its production method. Hydrogen is classified as grey, blue and blue hydrogen today as a short hand of the production pathways, each of which has very different implications on greenhouse gas emissions, resource and ecological trade-offs.",
      "Visualisation of global hydrogen production. Grey hydrogen mainly formed through the steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas but without carbon capture at present has an absolute majority in global production. It has great impact on climate and lifecycle emissions of hydrogen can surpass 1015 kg CO 2 -equivalent of 1 kilogram of hydrogen. Blue hydrogen, by comparison, also includes carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a part of the SMR process with a view to minimizing net emissions, though like SMR itself it still relies on fossil feedstocks and is susceptible to both methane fugitive emissions and varying levels of CO 2 capture effectiveness. The one I commonly hear extolled as the most sustainable is green hydrogen, made by electrolysing water with renewable energy; but it has issues with land use, water requirements, and power intermittency. The variety in this requires a stringent, comparative analysis of the claims of sustainability of each pathway.",
      "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an effective approach that offers an elaborate methodology to measure the environmental effects of the production of hydrogen at its supply chain. In contrast to the energy accounting used in traditional accounting that only covers the operational emissions, LCA backs upstream and downstream exactly that is, beginning with raw materials extraction and ending at the point of delivery. Using ISO 14040/14044 standards, in this study, a cradle-to-gate LCA is used in order to systematically assess and compare the LCA results of grey, blue, and green hydrogen technologies. It is not just the direct and indirect emissions that the goal aims at quantifying but rather resource flows like energy input, water use and land occupation and environmental trade-offs as fossil depletion as well as possible ecological strain.",
      "The distinguishing criteria associated with this study are its precision and depth. It is an improvement on existing LCA databases such as Eco invent v3 and simulation software such as SimaPro and GREET and combines regional differences in power grid emissions, natural gas leakage rates, and CO 2 sequestration performance. Also, it does more than one indicator assessment (e.g. carbon footprint) and provides a multi-dimensional impact profile. These will be using midpoint indicators including Global Warming Potential (GWP), fossil resource depletion, and water stress which allow an overall sustainability assessment of hydrogen pathways. The sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is used to reflect variation of key parameters where sensitivity to efficiency of electrolyser, effectiveness of CCS and renewable energy mix are uncertainties whose conclusions can be made stronger and policy relevant.",
      "The aim of this research is finally to define the life-cycle hotspots and critical trade-offs in every Hydrogen production pathway. The problem of emitting methane and incomplete decarbonization is significant in such hydrogen as grey and blue. In green hydrogen, the material and energy requirements of the production infrastructure, water and land consumption involve non-trivial factors in the environmental cost. This makes it effective in policy, infrastructure spending and technology development regarding hydrogen in making evidence-based decisions by measuring the impacts and putting them into context of decarbonization targets. Therein lies the only true contribution to a more realistic, more nuanced view on just what hydrogen is in the context of the energy transition, namely: not based in rhetoric but based in a system level analysis of all things.",

We assume use of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser (a common technology). Upstream of the electrolyser we include renewable power generation (wind turbines or solar PV farms), with associated land and material inputs.

    conclusion: [
      "Expected Outcomes",
      "We expect green, grey, and blue hydrogen to show distinctly different life-cycle environmental profiles. In terms of GWP, grey hydrogen is anticipated to be the highest. Literature reports grey H2 GWP on the order of 10–15 kg CO2e per kg H2 (cradle-to-gate).",
      "In contrast, green hydrogen powered by renewables can be an order of magnitude lower: Patel et al. found wind-based electrolysis as low as 0.6 kgCO2kg and even solar-based ~2.5 kgCO2/kg; overall averages for renewables-powered electrolysis are around 2.0 kgCO2/kg.",
      "Blue hydrogen falls in between: e.g. Patel et al. report ~7.6–9.3 kgCO2/kg H2 for natural gas routes with CCS. Under best-case conditions (high CO2 capture, very low methane leakage), blue H2 GWP can approach only a few kgCO2/kg (comparable to the upper end of green H2).",
      "Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",
      "Important UN SDGs are directly supported by this analysis. Because it encourages clean fuels and applies life-cycle thinking to resource use, assessing low-carbon hydrogen pathways advances SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).",
      "By measuring the GHG emissions of each hydrogen route, it also addresses SDG 13 (Climate Action), guiding decisions that lessen their impact on the climate. By showing that green H2 production (using renewables) can almost completely eliminate CO2 emissions per unit of energy, for instance, policies and investments in clean energy infrastructure are encouraged.",
      "The findings will, in general, direct sustainable energy transitions by determining which hydrogen technologies best fulfil the targets of SDGs 7/12/13 and by emphasising the significance of incorporating emissions controls and renewable power into hydrogen strategies.",

      "Climate change is getting worse every year. Environmental harm is more visible now than ever. Following the global agreement of the United Nations, which is known as the Sustainable Development Goals, environmental responsibility has been the guiding metric for many corporations. (United Nations, 2015) Companies are judged by consumers, investors, and the media. This has led to an increase in “green messaging” in brand images and marketing. It has given rise to false or misleading marketing tactics used by many corporations. This phenomenon is known as greenwashing. It is the practice of making a good, service, or policy seem less harmful or more ecologically friendly than it is. As the need to fulfill the global agreement that  (SDGs) increases, the abuse of environmental branding misleads the stakeholders and delays real climate action. This paper studies greenwashing and how branding supports it. It also dives deep into how vague claims hinder trust among consumers. It also explores audits and standards that can help support genuine climate-conscious campaigns and corporations.",

Jay Westerveld, an environmentalist, first used the term 'greenwashing' in 1986.",
          "Westerveld's inspiration came from a 1983 trip to Fiji, where a hotel promoted a towel reuse program as an eco-friendly initiative. However, the hotel was simultaneously undergoing significant expansion, causing ecological disruption. This contradiction led Westerveld to realize the hotel's true intention was to save costs, not protect the environment.

It highlights how PHC is situated at the intersection of health SDGs and global health equity but remains underemphasised in foreign policy. Through the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper illustrates how donor-led vertical programmes, conditionality of foreign aid, and geopolitics have a propensity to subvert entire PHC development. It calls for PHC mainstreaming in foreign policy through global health diplomacy, intersectoral coordination, and policy change, emphasising equitable access to PHC boosts social resilience, economic stability, and global security.",

      "“Health is not merely the absence of disease—it is a matter of social justice. And diplomacy must serve justice.”",
      "— Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organisation",
      "The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines Primary Health Care (PHC) as a 'whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people’s needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care, and as close as feasible to people’s everyday environment.' This holistic definition situates Primary Health Care (PHC) at the very core of efforts to build a resilient universal health coverage system. The WHO Constitution (1946) recognises health as a fundamental human right and recognises the role of PHC in attaining global health equity. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), under Article 12, obligates states to ensure access to the highest attainable standard of health, including disease prevention and essential services. The idea that everyone should have access to basic health services took centre stage with the Alma-Ata Declaration in 1978, which introduced Primary Health Care (PHC) as the path to achieving “Health for All”. It emphasised fairness, accessibility, and the active role of communities in shaping their own health. The Astana Declaration of 2018 re-established PHC as a central tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It brought renewed focus to three pillars, not in silos—delivering health services throughout people’s lives, working across different sectors, and empowering individuals and communities to take charge of their health and well-being.",

PHC is essential to achieving SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, specifically its objectives for Universal Health Coverage (UHC), reducing maternal and infant mortality, preventing and controlling infectious and non-communicable diseases, and ensuring access to essential medical care and prescription medications (SDG 3.b).",
          "Beyond its primary role in achieving SDG 3, the impact of PHC extends to other Sustainable Development Goals as well, given its integrated approach to addressing the societal and environmental determinants of health. By mitigating the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure and arresting the risk of impoverishment due to healthcare costs, PHC contributes significantly to SDG 1 (No Poverty).",

      "The foreign policy decisions made by foreign nations (i.e., through aid, engagement, trust, and restrictions) have significant ramifications on the PHC delivery system in sub-Saharan Africa. Sustainable improvements in access to PHC are hinged on ensuring donor alignment to national priorities and investment in health system strengthening (i.e., without political conditionalities that limit/undermine the service delivery). Countries should promote “health diplomacy”, which seeks to make cooperative international partnerships rather than political conditionalities for speedy development, while also depoliticising the humanitarian nature of health assistance and support. Policymakers need to work towards protecting health infrastructure from donor countries’ sanctions while also safeguarding workforce development from the effects of foreign sanctions and isolation.",
      "The link between foreign policy and primary health care must be segregated, and countries must devise plans to incorporate long-term solutions in combating health emergencies so that primary health care can evolve into universal health care with recognition of global health equity.",

      "Cultural diplomacy, although rooted in age-long cross-cultural interactions (Grincheva, 2023), is a 21st century’s pillar of soft power in foreign policy and diplomatic relations. It is a branch of foreign policy where countries utilise the uniqueness of their culture to facilitate their diplomatic goals. According to Milton Cummings, cultural diplomacy can be described as the “exchange of ideas, information, art, language and other aspects of culture among nations and peoples in order to foster mutual understanding” (UNESCO, 2023).",
      "Made up of people from diverse religions, languages, cultures and regions, India is not new to the concept of cross-cultural relations. At the national level, India practices interculturalism, encouraging regional diversity and acceptance by promoting pluralism (Manian & Naidu, 2009).  At the global stage, India engages in cultural exchange, sharing its cultural practices with the rest of the world in its diplomatic pursuit. In multilateral forums such as the United Nations, India has emphasised cultural heritage as a universal connector. India’s role in founding the International Solar Alliance aimed at promoting sustainable development in the world’s environment is founded on ancient Indian philosophies like the Prakriti Dharma (harmony with nature) (Mohanapriya & Suriya, 2025). This subtly links India’s past with a vision for the future. Moreover, India's engagement with Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America is increasingly rooted in cultural commonalities. Initiatives like Bharat Ko Janiye (Know India Programme) for youth of Indian origin and cultural festivals (Douw et al., 2024) organised through embassies promote mutual respect and cooperation.",
      "This paper, therefore, reviews India’s use of cultural diplomacy as an important diplomatic approach for positive and peaceful global engagement. In it, the authors examine the historical roots of cultural diplomacy and explore its application within the Indian context, citing select concepts as examples. Furthermore, the paper distils the challenges and successes stemming from India’s diplomatic use of culture as a significant political influence, suggesting recommendations for future initiatives.",

As quoted in “India’s Cultural Diplomacy: Present Dynamics, Challenges, and Future Prospects” by Bhanu Pratap, C. Raja Mohan mentions that “India's self-discovery of its rich cultural heritage and its global reach played an important role in shaping its modern nationalism.” In the post-independence scenario, the Indian government has promoted cultural diplomacy through various means; some examples include the Buddhism tourism circuit in the eastern parts of India, as mentioned by Pranay Kumar in “Soft Power and Cultural Diplomacy in the Contemporary World.” According to Shetty and Sehgal in their article “India's Soft Power: Challenges and Opportunities,” India’s cultural diplomacy is exercised through a complex engagement of state and non-state actors. “Red Lantern Analytica (2024)” highlights India's soft power limitations due to institutional fragmentation, overreliance on select cultural exports like Yoga and Bollywood, and lack of evaluation frameworks. “UN (2014)” affirms India’s global cultural influence through the International Day of Yoga, recognized in over 190 countries, marking a major success in soft power diplomacy.",

          "After gaining independence, India's engagement with the world wasn't just political or economic-it was deeply cultural, shaped by the richness of its civilizational heritage. The spirit of the Bhakti movement, with its message of love, equality, and devotion, found a renewed voice in this new era. Saints like Kabir and Meera, who spoke across caste and creed, became quiet ambassadors of India's inclusive ethos, especially through diaspora-led cultural festivals and performances abroad. India also began using its spiritual heritage as a form of soft diplomacy. Sacred relics—especially Buddhist ones—were sent on international tours, creating bridges of faith and friendship. At the same time, India sought to bring home important artifacts from overseas, symbolically reclaiming its past and reaffirming its identity on the world stage.(ICCR 2024)",
          "The Indian diaspora, shaped by histories of colonial-era migration, played a key role in carrying these traditions forward. Across Africa, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific, these communities preserved languages, rituals, and festivals, becoming cultural anchors in faraway lands.",
          "Old Buddhist ties with countries like Japan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka were reawakened through initiatives like the revival of Nalanda University and the creation of the Buddhist Circuit—efforts that highlighted shared history and spiritual bonds.(IJHAMS-Bhanu Pratap, 2015)",
          "Even ancient trade routes—once busy with spices, silk, and stories—were reimagined as cultural highways, reminders that India had long been a crossroads not just of commerce but of ideas and philosophies.",
          "As a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, India didn’t just promote political neutrality; it also brought forward values deeply rooted in its civilizational soul—non-violence, pluralism, and solidarity. In doing so, India showed the world that its cultural identity wasn’t a relic of the past, but a living force shaping its place on the global stage. However, the implementation happened over a complex interplay of state and non-state mechanisms, creatively stationed to satiate India’s growing ambitions to portray its cultural image.",

          "Through state diplomacy as well as through the very structure of the state itself, the Indian state plays a big role in cultural diplomacy. Being a democracy, rather the world’s largest democracy, naturally adds to it as one of its key advantages, and so do its democratic institutions in better connecting with a shared cohort of values and belief systems (Shetty & Sehgal, 2019). The MEA’s Public Diplomacy Division and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) were established for this very purpose.",
          "The ICCR, with centres in around 37 countries, plays a direct role in augmenting people’s cultural knowledge about India. Alongside it strives to revive and strengthen the cultural ties between India and other countries (Chakraborty, 2019). However, the central task of planning, designing, and implementing public diplomacy programmes in cooperation with relevant government and non-governmental agencies rests with the MEA’s Public Diplomacy Division. The Public Diplomacy Division, which, after its 2014 merger with the External Publicity Division, became the External Publicity and Public Diplomacy Division, is entrusted with four key responsibilities (not limited to). These include the production of audio-visual and print materials portraying the rich cultural spectrum of India, organising outreach activities for creating a more sympathetic image of India and its foreign policy, organising seminars and conferences in collaboration with Indian and foreign universities, think tanks, and chambers of commerce, and hosting delegations from various foreign countries and organisations to India (Laskar, 2019). Besides the institutions, the government has tended to exploit the benefits accrued through its huge diaspora by holding conventions like the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD), utilised the civilisational connect with various Asian countries, and curated tourism outreach initiatives like the Incredible India campaign to leverage its cultural diplomacy.",
          "However, the best soft power deliverables are rarely state-driven; rather, they are mostly exercised through private institutions or individuals. In India’s case, Bollywood, Indian television serials, BCCI, cuisine, classical art, and music have gained significant clout, at times in collaboration with the state, to propagate India’s image abroad. Bollywood movies have long enjoyed unparalleled popularity globally, with audiences hailing not just from South Asia, but also from Central Asia, West Asia, parts of Africa, and Latin America. Added, considerable leverage comes from the excruciating popularity of some Indian celebrities. Next in line, the Indian soap operas have proved themselves as no less. Serials like Balika Vadhu, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, and most recently Anupama have huge digital impressions recorded from several countries. Similarly, the Indian Premier League has been part of the popularity bandwagon since its initiation. In terms of Indian art and music, artists like Pandit Ravi Shankar, Lata Mangeshkar and A.R. Rahman, fashion designers like Manish Malhotra and Sabyasachi, chefs like Vikas Khanna, Sanjeev Kapoor and Vineet Bhatia are recognised worldwide. Together they help exude an increased respect for India, its culture and its diversity (Shetty & Sehgal, 2019).",

          "India's contemporary cultural diplomacy policy rests primarily on its civilizational self-image as a Vishwaguru (mentor to the world) and Vishwabandhu (world friend), positioning itself as an advocate of peace, discussion, and “Vasudhaiva kutumbakam” collective prosperity. Within the Vishwaguru framework, India showcases its ancient epistemological systems—like Yoga, Ayurveda, and Sanskrit—as global public goods. The UN's International Day of Yoga, (UN, 2014) launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 and embraced by the UN the same year, is today observed in more than 190 nations and is often viewed as India's greatest cultural export success. India’s Vishwabandhu identity is backed by its compassionate initiatives like Vaccine Maitri, cultural solidarity with the Global South, and cultivating value-based cooperation through the cultural track of the G20 under India's 2023 Presidency (G20, 2023).",
          "Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, is observed every two years to acknowledge and celebrate the Indian diaspora's contribution to national growth and its vast international reach. The MEA has also launched Initiatives such as the “Bharat Ko Janiye Quiz” which aims to promote cultural identity for second- and third-generation Indian diaspora abroad through interactive sessions and tailored visits to India (MEA, 2024). One of the most successful initiatives is the “Festival of India Abroad”, celebrated in 50+ countries on themes such as Namaste India (Japan) and India by the Nile (Egypt). These government-sponsored events feature Indian dance, food, films, and crafts, underlining bilateral cultural relations (ICCR, 2024).",
          "“Repatriation of heritage” is another high-engagement diplomatic initiative that can be included under the cultural diplomacy of India. Since 2014, India has repatriated more than 300 stolen artefacts from nations like the U.S, U.K, and Australia reflecting a commitment for restoration of its centuries old civilizational pride. (MOC, 2023).",
          "In addition, India has welcomed digital cultural diplomacy. The 2023 G20 Culture Track, with the theme Culture Unites All, focused on heritage protection, cultural diversity, and sustainability, thus incorporating culture into the broader foreign policy domain. The most significant milestone in India's cultural diplomacy this year is the Waves Summit (Waves, 2025), which was launched on 12th June in Mumbai. Organized by Reliance and backed by the government, it established India as a global creative hub. With the involvement of 90+ nations, Rs. 1,300 crore value deals, and the WAVES Declaration signed by 77 countries, the summit promoted Indian content, crafts, and stories around the world.

          "One of the key sources of India’s cultural diplomacy has been its diaspora. Aside from its home country, the Indian diaspora is one of the world's largest populations, with members in practically every country. The Indian diaspora vies with other ethnic groups for political and economic influence in many nations worldwide. In industrial nations including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, India also has a notable footprint. The Indian population mostly serves as a type of soft power in these countries. As per UN Global migration report of 2020, approximately 17.5 million people who identify Indian origin live outside their native country (Singh, 2020). From ancient times to the colonial era and even into the twenty-first century with globalization, this diaspora has evolved across history since the time of the early recorded Indian kingdoms. Motherland has been greatly influenced by the varied ages of Indian migration to several regions of the world.",
          "The Indian diaspora has really been quite engaged in the development of India. It has become more and more clear that India relies on the Indian diaspora for its survival over time. The growth of India has depended much on the philanthropic activities and development of its people living abroad who have sent money back home. Investments made by entrepreneurs from the Indian diaspora have helped to improve the Indian economy. Becoming a major soft power, Indian Diasporas help to define India's links with the nations they live.",
          "Views in North America often mix interest in India's spiritual practices (such as Yoga and Ayurveda) and its growing technology sector, meanwhile tackling concerns about human rights issues and administrative challenges. In this sense, cultural diplomacy often centre on the vast Indian diaspora, therefore improving relations via festivals, traditional arts, and educational initiatives. Bollywood has a small but devoted following. But to solve erratic communication and opposing narratives, it is widely accepted that India's entertainment business and cultural legacy must be used more systematically.",
          "European points of view differ greatly. Countries like the UK, which have historical links, frequently view India from a viewpoint formed by their shared history—sometimes influenced by vestiges of colonialism. Germany and France might start to focus more on the economic potential of contemporary India. Along with classical music, dance, and the range of Indian celebrations, cultural diplomacy often highlights Yoga and Ayurveda.",
          "India's cultural diplomacy in Africa is especially noteworthy, often drawing on historical links and common experiences as countries still evolving. With a large and long-lasting audience, Indian film, often referred to as Bollywood, influences local fashions, music, and social values. Cultural ideas are exchanged greatly valued by the Indian diaspora. Initiatives like International Day of Yoga and promotion of Ayurveda are much appreciated. India's emphasis on improving abilities and fostering South- South cooperation through cultural exchanges helps to build a good image, sometimes seen as a reliable development partner.",
          "Many years of sea trade and the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism have given India a major historical and cultural influence in this region. In the language, architecture, and art of the region, this 'Indic' influence is very strong. Encouraging tourism, building Buddhist circuit schemes, arranging cultural celebrations (like Namaste India), and encouraging academic collaborations help to strengthen these long-running relationships.",

Views in the Middle East are largely influenced by the large Indian population working in the Gulf, which helps to raise both economies. Moreover, the Diaspora also has considerable influence on the bilateral relations between the two countries. Hence, it is essential for the Indian Government to ensure the wellbeing of the Diaspora either through appropriate policy measures or by engaging in dialogue and deliberations with the Middle East (Biswas, 2020). Recent initiatives like the BAPS temple in the UAE reflect the growing cultural ties as well as robust financial and strategic partnerships like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).The Indian diaspora is a powerful instrument of India’s soft power, promoting cultural, economic, and diplomatic influence globally. By organizing cultural events, contributing economically, and advocating for India’s interests, the diaspora enhances India’s global image (Hussain & Rather, 2022).",

          "Despite its increasing cultural presence, India's cultural diplomacy is plagued by several structural and strategic issues of which Institutional fragmentation is one such big problem. The ICCR, the Ministry of External Affairs' Public Diplomacy Division and other state initiatives, often operate independently, with little to no coordination between them. This prevents effective cultural diplomacy and results in duplication and watering down of efforts. Another major concern is the lack of strong financial support, which hinders consistency of programmes— compared to more traditionally 'culture-supporting' nations such as China or the UK.",
          "India's cultural diplomacy is also threatened by its overdependence on Yoga, Ayurveda, and Bollywood, restricting resonance in areas such as Latin America, Francophone Africa, and Eastern Europe where local adaptation is poor. Most initiatives are on an ad-hoc basis and event-based, with no formal feedback or evaluation processes. Language issues, inadequate funding, and lack of coordination further undermine long-term influence. ",
          "Still, when done well and consistently, India's cultural diplomacy has proven to be powerful. The International Day of Yoga is the best example for sustained long-term international engagement that emphasizes India's civilizational values. The 2025 WAVES Summit which showed India's capacity to link culture with commerce and innovation by inviting 90+ nations and securing significant economic alliances is also a great example of India's most recent success in its global engagement efforts (Waves, 2025).

What was once a symbolic soft power gesture must now evolve into a coherent, inclusive, and strategic global engagement model. While India’s cultural assets—ranging from Yoga and Ayurveda to cinema, cuisine, and diaspora connections—are globally recognized, their full potential remains underutilized due to fragmented outreach, limited coordination, and inadequate resourcing.",
          "The road ahead demands a fundamental rethinking of both policy and implementation. The Standing Committee on External Affairs has laid a foundation for this transformation, emphasizing the urgent need to restructure the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR)—India’s primary cultural outreach body. A clearly defined mandate, decentralized functioning, and a Rs. 500 crore budget enhancement are essential first steps to ensure ICCR can respond effectively to global cultural demands.",
          "Equally critical is institutional coordination. India must break down silos between the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Education, and other stakeholders. A formal coordination committee and joint working groups should drive a unified cultural diplomacy strategy, with shared databases and measurable objectives tailored to regional contexts.",
          "Looking forward, India must adopt continent-specific cultural strategies. Africa would benefit from collaborative art and heritage programs; Latin America could respond to Ayurveda and wellness diplomacy; and East Asia holds promise for cinema and literary outreach. These engagements must be grounded in authenticity and inclusivity, avoiding cultural appropriation and ideological overtones that risk alienating global audiences.",
          "Digital platforms, storytelling tools, and diaspora-led outreach will be crucial to making India’s culture more accessible and engaging. A Yoga Certification Board, as proposed by the Committee, can help preserve the integrity of Indian traditions in global practice. Meanwhile, tourism promotion should follow a country-specific model informed by real-time visitor feedback, supported by expanded overseas tourism offices.",

    intro: [
      "Women's empowerment in India is deeply intertwined with the complexities of unpaid employment, caste hierarchies, and intersecting social factors. Unpaid domestic and care work remains a central barrier to women's economic empowerment, with Indian women disproportionately burdened by such responsibilities. Being a woman in India often means shouldering a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, navigating patriarchal societal norms, and facing significant barriers to education, employment, and healthcare. This work, largely invisible in economic statistics and undervalued in policy, restricts women’s labor force participation and perpetuates dependency and marginalization. According to the World Bank, women in India spend an average of 5 hours and 35 minutes per day on unpaid care work, compared to 38 minutes per day for men.(Observer Research Foundation. (2022, October 17)) [OBSERVE RESEARCH FOUNDATION,(2022, OCTOBR 17]",
      "Caste and class further compound the issue. Patriarchal norms are more rigid among higher castes, limiting women’s mobility and autonomy, while lower-caste women, despite higher labor force participation, often face double burdens—engaging in both unpaid care and low-paid informal sector work. (Rege, S. (1998)) [REGE, S.(1998)].The lived experience of empowerment is highly variable, shaped by hereditary and localized caste dynamics.(Chopra, D., & Zambelli, E. (2017))[CHOPRA, D.,&ZAMBELLI, E. (2017)] Public policy responses have included affirmative action, reservations, and employment schemes , which offer frameworks for women to claim rights, but implementation gaps persist. The Government of India has initiated various schemes and policies to promote women's empowerment, including the National Policy for Women's Empowerment in 2001. Initiatives like microfinance programs, skill development training, and entrepreneurship support to enhance women's economic independence that will play a significant role in reducing the unpaid work culture of women. Social Empowerment by making efforts to address social issues like education, health, and violence against women, promoting gender equality and social justice which will make women uplift their position in India. Political Empowerment by  Reservation of seats for women in local governance bodies, promoting women's participation in decision-making processes. Studies indicate a positive impact of government initiatives on women's empowerment, but challenges persist, including societal attitudes, lack of awareness, and limited access to resources. Effective implementation and monitoring of policies are crucial to achieving desired outcomes. (Desai, S., & Thakkar, U. (2007)) [DESAI, S.& THAKKAR, U.(2007)]",
      "Ultimately, transforming women’s status requires a holistic approach: recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid work, challenging patriarchal norms, improving education, and ensuring inclusive policy design that addresses both structural and intersectional inequities.

          "Caste and gender are not parallel forces of discrimination in India—they are deeply entangled and mutually reinforcing. The lived realities of Dalit, Adivasi, and OBC women are decisively different from those of upper-caste women, not because they are less subject to patriarchy, but because they suffer both simultaneously: the gender-based oppression and the caste-based oppression. These dual burdens often go unreckoned in mainstream feminist discourse, which has historically centered the experiences and priorities of urban, upper-caste women.",
          " In rural and urban settings, caste determines access to education, healthcare, mobility, employment, and security. A Dalit woman, for example, risks sexual assault, systemic police apathy, and social boycott. NCRB statistics register a steady rise in crimes against Dalit women, with conviction rates that remain hair-raisingly low. This disparity reflects a failure not only in judicial mechanisms but also in public policy, which often addresses gender violence in caste-neutral terms—ignoring the specific vulnerabilities of marginalized communities.",
          " Reservation policies in education and employment were designed to uplift marginalized groups, but they frequently fail to consider intra-caste gender disparities. A Dalit man may benefit from such policies while the Dalit woman in the same household remains confined to unpaid domestic labor, often excluded from leadership roles and political participation. Institutions like the National Commission for Women or the Ministry of Women and Child Development seldom incorporate caste-sensitive frameworks into their mandates, leaving the most vulnerable women without adequate support.",
          " 'Savarna feminism'  constitutes a serious bottleneck to all-inclusive policymaking. Even feminist activism that does not listen to Dalit and Adivasi voices tends to function as the instrument through which the existing hierarchy sustains itself in the rhetoric of empowerment. Feminism must truly challenge caste as an apparatus of domination to fulfill its promise of gender justice.",
          " To make feminist policy truly inclusive, an intersectional approach is essential—one that combines gender justice with caste equity. This requires disaggregated data collection, support for Dalit- and Adivasi-led movements, caste- and gender-responsive budgeting, and direct representation of marginalized women in legislative and policymaking spaces. Only by centering the most oppressed can public policy move from symbolic reform to genuine social transformation.",

        heading: "Unpaid Labour and the Erasure of Women’s Work ",
        paragraphs: [
          "To be a woman in India is to navigate a complex terrain where empowerment is simultaneously celebrated in rhetoric and denied in everyday realities, particularly through the persistent undervaluation and invisibilisation of women’s labour. To be a woman in India is to carry the economic weight of the nation invisibly — through undervalued informal labour and unpaid care work — while being systematically excluded from recognition in policy and statistical frameworks. At the intersection of feminist political economy and public policy lies the urgent issue of unaccounted work. The India Employment Report 2019 shows that while women’s labour force participation rate (LFPR) has been declining — from 42.7% in 2004–05 to 23.3% in 2017–18 — this statistical drop conceals the persistent and unpaid economic contributions of women, especially in household production, caregiving, and subsistence activities (Mehrotra & Parida, 2019). These forms of work are either excluded from labour statistics or misclassified, undermining both visibility and valuation. The I-PEEL framework critiques this erasure by asserting that unpaid domestic and care work is foundational to capitalist production, yet remains ideologically framed as “non-work,” exempting both the state and the market from redistributive responsibility (I-PEEL, n.d.). Feminist economists like Bina Agarwal have long argued that the binary between ‘productive’ and ‘reproductive’ labour, as imposed by mainstream economics, fails to reflect the material reality of Indian women’s lives. For instance, the Time Use Survey (2019) revealed that Indian women spend nearly 299 minutes per day on unpaid domestic work, compared to only 97 minutes for men. Yet this contribution is absent from national income accounts and marginal in policy discourses.",
          "Moreover, even when women are in the paid workforce, they are overwhelmingly concentrated in informal, insecure, and poorly remunerated jobs. As Dutta (2005) shows, casual work constitutes a key segment of India’s female labour market, where returns to education are negligible, and wage disparities are driven more by occupational segregation than individual characteristics. Dutta’s analysis reveals that while wage inequality among casual workers appeared to decline from 1983 to 1999, this shift masked persistent gendered segmentation and spatial concentration of women in low-value, home-based activities.",
          "Public policy, while increasingly vocal about women’s empowerment, remains fixated on short-term welfare approaches rather than long-term structural transformation. Skill-building programmes, microfinance, and livelihood missions often promote instrumental gains without challenging the underlying systems that devalue women’s time and labour. The India Employment Report notes that rising education among women has not translated into proportionate employment, partly because of the absence of care infrastructure, safe public transport, and formal recognition of women’s labour (Mehrotra & Parida, 2019). A feminist policy framework would prioritise three Rs: recognition of unpaid work in national accounting systems; redistribution of care responsibilities through public provisioning; and representation of women in policy making bodies that shape labour and social welfare norms. To be a woman in India is to be structurally indispensable yet statistically invisible. Remedying this paradox requires rethinking the foundations of work, value, and policy accountability.",

        heading: "Wage inequality and Choice of occupation",
        paragraphs: [
          "Women’s empowerment in India represents a complex and multidimensional challenge that has been systematically addressed through public policy initiatives. While notable progress has been achieved in the direction, two significant barriers continue to limit women’s economic advancement in India: wage inequality and restricted occupational choices. The subject has gathered much attention in recent years owing to the structured inequalities rooted in gender, caste, and class which continue to shape women’s work experiences and earnings, despite significant attempts at policy interventions, legal safeguards, and growing awareness. According to World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2024, India’s low rank (129th out of 146 countries) in gender parity score, with women earning 20–30% less than men on average, communicates low female labour-force participation rates and gender disparities in leadership roles, despite the existence of comparable educational backgrounds and experience levels among women. A 2008 report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) identifies that women employment is largely seen in “typically female” job roles (e.g., caregiving, domestic work), which are often unpaid or underpaid. Systemic factors like occupational segregation, underrepresentation in leadership roles, and undervaluation of “feminine” labor perpetuate a cycle of unequal power dynamics and thus, act as key contributors to the issue. Gender wage gap and less occupational choices involve multidimensional reasons ranging from socio-cultural constraints that hinder participation to lack of human capital development among women. Societal expectations and unequal distribution of caregiving and domestic responsibilities limits women’s competence in the economic domain. Gender norms, safety concerns, family responsibilities, and lack of childcare infrastructure push women into low-paying, insecure jobs—primarily in the informal sector. There also exists disparity in professions where women are rarely promoted to leadership roles and when they do enter male-dominated professions, they often encounter a “glass ceiling”. Other social identities like caste, religion, and socio-economic background exacerbate this inequality since Dalit and Adivasi women, in particular, are often relegated to the most exploitative forms of labor with little or no legal protections. These women face severe intersectional discrimination that limits their occupational choices and well-paid jobs. This points to the fact ‘Policies exist, but their implementation lags’. Achieving gender equality is not just a matter of policy announcement but also of its effective implementation. Policies, skilling programs and employment schemes, such as Equal Remuneration Act, Skill India and PMKVY, are steps in the right direction but often fail to address local social barriers or caste-gender intersections.",

        heading: "Role of Intersectionality on Labour Market of India",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Indian labour market is deeply influenced by the intersecting dynamics of caste, class, gender, and ethnicity, which shape opportunities and exclusions in complex ways. The concept of intersectionality, first articulated by (Crenshaw (1989)), provides a critical lens to understand how these social categories compound disadvantages in employment contexts. In India, caste and gender play a particularly dominant role in marginalizing large sections of the workforce.(Bazaz and Akram (2021))bring to light how gender and caste intersectionality severely restricts the availability of education and work for lower caste Muslim women, who are subject to double jeopardy in patriarchal and caste-divided frameworks. Upper caste Muslim women, although still circumscribed by patriarchal structures, are comparatively more educationally and occupationally mobile on account of being able to utilise caste capital.In addition, (Jameel et al. (2024)) illustrate that Indian women’s experiences in the workplace are not the same. Dalit and Adivasi women, for instance, confront interlocking disadvantages on grounds of caste, socio-economic status, and gender, resulting in systemic marginalization and restricted career advancement in professional settings. This underlines the limitations of understanding women’s labour market participation from gender alone, calling for an intersectional lens.(Nayak (2020))reinforces this point by demonstrating that in Odisha’s coal mining industry, caste, class, and gender all combine to determine labour segmentation. Marginalized groups, particularly Dalit women, are disproportionately found in the most insecure and informal work, which means that their labour conditions are not merely economically exploitative but also socially stratified. Generally speaking, the Indian labor market is a structure of layers in which social identities construct both privilege and barriers jointly. Intersectionality provides a more nuanced framework to explain these intersecting structures of oppression and demands policy interventions which account for such complexity.",

          "The Disconnect Between Policy in Writing and Policy in Action",
          "India has created a great number of public policies and laws that promote women’s empowerment and gender equality. From the very principles laid out in the Constitution where equality is guaranteed [Constitution of India], to the explicitly legislative frameworks, the country's commitment towards gender justice is also indicated through: the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005) (PWDVA, 2005) and; the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (2013) [POSH Act, 2013]; amendment of the Hindu Succession Act that gives women equal rights to inherit property [HSA, 2005] and the government-led campaigns that aim to change society’s current outlook on improving young girls' welfare (Beti Bachao Beti Padhao) [GoI, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao]. Together, these policies in writing suggest a comprehensive and potentially progressive approach to women’s rights.",
          "Nevertheless, there exists a perennial and critical problem of the gap between the policies themselves (which may have been painstakingly developed) and the way in which they put into practice. There are many factors causing this implementation gap that are intertwined with a bunch of socio-cultural, economic and administrational factors. The major factor is the patriarchal mind-set in different areas of society. After all that said, the primary barrier is that even when there is legal protection, customary gender roles and attitudes can stigmatize women's independent choices and roles.",
          "Nevertheless, a chronic and major challenge remains in the difference between the carefully constructed policies and their implementation. This difference can be explained by a set of multi-layered socio-cultural, economic, and administrative issues. A main challenge is the pervasive patriarchal mindset manifested across the layers of society, and the pervasive and long-standing nature of certain roles and expectations assigned to women in society compounds this issue. This contributes to the possibility of underreporting of gender-based violence; contributes to societal pressure on victims to withdraw complaints; and male-oriented community responses to women asserting their rights. Such culture can essentially undermine even the strongest legal provisions. In addition to these pervasive factors there are very real, systemic administrative challenges that also impede effective implementation; some examples include resource allocation, professional development for those on the front lines, and administrative barriers to accessing knowledge [Gov. Report, 2020]. For instance, while many substantive legal rights exist under statutory law that prohibits domestic violence, when the rights (like access to services, safe shelter, and adequate legal support) are inconvenient, inaccessible and unusable they are useless to provide protection or safe pathways for victims to extricate themselves from a potentially dangerous, sometimes lethal encounter [UN Women Report, 2023]. Likewise, while there is legislation which promotes equal pay for equal work, the large majority of women working in the informal sector, and the subtle, and less subtle, discriminatory practices that exist when it comes to recruitment and career development, wage differentials will persist [Economic Survey, 2024]. The lengthy and complicated judicial process also deters many women from pursuing justice [Legal Aid Review, 2019]. Closing this important gap requires more than a strong enforcement mechanism. It will be necessary to meaningfully address the patriarchal attitude that is pervasive in society, and support women at the community level to understand and exercise their full rights and realize violence-free potential in employment.",

          "Unintended Consequences of Feminist Movements on Women's Rights in India ",
        paragraphs: [
          "Policymaking has long been accompanied with a predictable and unyielding reality, an adage as old as time, yet never untrue: resistance to change is inevitable. Men specifically have resisted policies that give women the autonomy and freedom to do as they please, unfortunately some women too. Only recently were women in Saudi Arabia allowed to drive (Specia, 2019), but this change has seen a rise in resistance to feminist laws - to date, activists for womens’ right to drive are still being jailed, even though this law was implemented in 2019. There are numerous other examples of resistance to policies that advocate for the freedom of women - for a country that is culturally rich and extremely patriarchal, India is no exception to this resistance. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, it is ironic that laws created to give women the liberty and freedom they so desire have been the catalyst for violence towards women and in some cases, even leading to death. In 2022, Genocide Watch declared a female genocide emergency in India (Kadiwa, 2023). In early 2023, Crime Record Bureau estimated that One Indian woman is killed every hour over patriarchal disputes (Al-Jazeera, 2023) and the arrest of female activists is not uncommon in India. When a government indirectly discourages a certain movement by imprisoning those who advocate for it, by repressing and silencing individuals, it brings to question whether the government truly cares for these specific rights and consequently exposes the hypocrisy and contradictions of that government. The arrests of Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal (International, 2020), female activists who were fighting against restrictions on female students in 2020 raises questions on the message that is trying to be delivered. Feminism has been considered threatening and undesirable by many patriarchal and oppressive regimes (Guardian, 2019), possibly because women have always been seen as property rather than people with individual desires and autonomy. Another reason why feminism is considered a threat is misconceptions on what feminism actually is, a majority of people ignorantly mistake feminism to be an agenda against men, when in reality feminism seeks only to establish women as independent entities, unshackled from society's expectations. It is also important to remember that in most cultural setups, men are considered powerful and invincible and feminism threatens this notion (Mitengu, 2019). It is truly unfortunate that the enactment of some feminist policies has resulted in violence against women, but it is the bravery of those who have suffered and died for this cause that make this movement and the policies that support it, all the more important.",

    intro: [
      `An American Journalist profoundly quoted on CNN, after Trump's ban on international students enrolled at Harvard, saying one of the basic reasons the US always has had an upper hand in diplomacy is primarily due to the enormous diaspora of international immigrants, especially university students, currently present in America. Once threatened or banned, this will cause a ripple effect in its day-to-day diplomatic relations. Followingly, Lawrence H. Summers, Former US Secretary of the Treasury and President of Harvard University, also commented on CNN, “We have always thought that a huge strength of the United States was what my late colleague Joe Nye called soft power. The power of our example, the fact that people from all over the world didn't want to go study in China, they wanted to go study in the United States. The people, the fact that the books, the movies, the songs that we sang, the technologies that we were the source of attraction for people from all over the world.”, proving how the promise of the American Dream was so lucrative that it attracted people from all walks of life, all across the globe.`,
      `Cultural diplomacy has transitioned from a passive byproduct of state image to an active tool of international strategy. During a brief academic immersion in Seoul, the dynamics of soft power were observed not in bureaucratic halls, but in bookstores,and cinema queues. A striking case was of the rising prominence of Crash Landing on You in a North Korean studies bookstore near Yonsei University. It, yet again, reminded the world how emotions and cultural integrities hold the world together.`,
      `This was not coincidental. South Korea’s state-led promotion of Hallyu, rooted in strategic investments since the late 1990s, has had a magnanimous effect on how it is regarded around the world. Through K-dramas, Korea isn’t merely telling stories; it is exporting identity, highlighting its values, and aesthetic hegemony. This article highlights how Korean entertainment functions as both an economic asset and a diplomatic envoy.`,
      `Furthermore, this article explores how these diplomatic strategies influence negotiation styles, communication frameworks, and conflict resolution approaches, particularly within Eastern and postcolonial contexts. By employing constructivist and postcolonial theoretical lenses, the paper argues that cultural diplomacy does not simply beautify foreign policy; it redefines power projection.`,
      `Utilizing both primary observations and secondary analyses, this article examines the cultural subtleties embedded within diplomacy—how Korea’s indirect, collectivist communication style contrasts with Western assertiveness; how Japan’s refinement supports long-term trust-building; and how India’s cooperative strategy reflects its civilizational values.`,
      `In an increasingly multipolar global landscape marked by ideological difference and diplomatic volatility, this article positions culture not as a vocabulary to diplomacy, but as its most enduring and persuasive form.`,

        heading: "The Impact of Soft Power",
        paragraphs: [
          `Soft power as defined by Joseph Nye is the ability to attract and co-opt rather than coerce. It is the capability to shape what others want to achieve through the indirect means of appeal and attraction, rather than through force or payments. In the zone of diplomacy, soft power's inherent yet indispensable device is the cultural norms of respective international partners and their level of reverent compliance. Cultural norms in diplomacy encompass the values, belief systems and practices of a civilisation. This civilisation lives under the allegiance of the state influencing its foreign policy objectives and how it interacts with other states. It exhibits the heterogeneity and proclamation of self-identity in the multipolar world. `,
          `The application of constructivism and postcolonialism in diplomatic dialogues and visits has pushed the West to be hyper-aware of its hegemony. This is a significant paradigm shift in terms of the identity of Commonwealth nations. These nations picked themselves up and endured the cathartic process to rejuvenate their suppressed culture under their oppressors, actively combating the neocolonialism of the multipolar world.`,
          `The cultural norms of a nation are subtly amplified by its dimensions of communication, negotiation tactics and conflict resolution. These are heavily characterised by their state of governance and the nation's history. Communication by western nations is often direct and outright, whereas eastern nations are indirect and employ non-verbal cues in their communication. Examples of these are the USA and China. The covert nature of Eastern culture can come under the purview of misunderstanding and is faced at times with escalated responses from fellow nations or provides enough duration to save face. An example of such communication is China's subtle signalling during the South China Sea disputes.`,
          `In terms of negotiation tactics, global powers either opt for a competitive strategy or a cooperative strategy. This dimension is well demonstrated with the example of the 2025 tariff war between the US and China. America had a competitive strategy to curb the dependency of its manufacturing sectors of the economy on the Chinese.`,
          `However, the deal turned into a geoeconomic dispute when the Chinese power did not comply and the USA had a bigger chunk of its tax system at stake. The peripheral player of global politics, India, on the other hand, approached the USA with a benevolent cooperative strategy that held mutual benefits and also re-established its leader status quo in the Southeast Asian economies.`,
          `The mode of conflict resolution is a minefield in the cultural norms of soft power. Nations either take a confrontational approach or a non-confrontational approach. A confrontational approach may not necessarily mean escalation of a conflict. It also points to addressing the conflict through dialogues without avoiding the conflict. This approach holds one party accountable and gives the opportunity to the global players to take a stance on the conflict. This maintains the momentum in the international relations arena. An example of this is the Galwan Valley issue between India and China. In the aftermath of this conflict, India resorts to a confrontational approach of public condemnation, banning of apps, deployment of troops along the Line of Actual Control (LOC), and building of infrastructure along the LOC border.`,
          `China, on the other hand, remained avoidant, downplaying the incident in the media, engaging in ambiguous international dialogues, deflecting international scrutiny and heavily emphasising economic diplomacy.`,
          `The diplomatic world from the Westphalian world order through the Cold War up until the unipolar and the current multipolar world has seen the emergence of innumerable organisations and forums for peace, stability and cooperation of the global powers. BRICS+, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) and several others are examples of global intergovernmental organisations that have been formed and chaired by countries that, in concrete terms, have red borders between them. Cultural diplomacy-driven soft power enables these countries to ease their tensions on these forums and collaborate for a greater good.`,
          `Whilst upholding foreign policy and principles of state on its diplomatic ties is the onus of a soft power agent, the cultural consciousness and behavioural communication of an attaché have the ability to amplify the intensity of such dialogues. The perfect and harmonised exercise of soft power and smart power is essential to prevent the need for hard power. Diplomatic disasters cost a heavy price in terms of the economy, politics and military of a country. Preventive diplomacy is better than a full-fledged conflict. `,
          `The multipolar world of the twenty-first century does not provide the impetus for nations to take unambiguous stances and cut-throat biases in the maintenance of international relations.`,

        paragraphs: [
          `Cultural diplomacy stands for one major dynamic of modern world politics, which does encompass those exchanges of ideas, languages, and even school supplies. In this way, nations build long-term trust and reduce their dependence on fear-based foreign policy. Sharing cultural goods humanizes nations, making diplomacy less confrontational and more personal.`,
          `South Korea, Japan, and France have, on different occasions, used cultural diplomacy strategically to be able to massively foment goodwill and constructive international images. . For instance, through language programs and cultural centers, France promotes its creativity and legacy abroad. Japan sees cultural and educational exchanges, and youth investment as long-term relationships and mutually beneficial partnerships, ultimately creating relationships that make it difficult to leave.`,
          `The Korean Wave, or Hallyu, is a global trend and a prime representation of how South Korea approaches cultural diplomacy. The growing interest in Korean pop culture, especially K-pop and in K-dramas, has changed the way the world perceives South Korea. The government has promoted the "Hallyu" entertainment industry, given its ability to reach a global audience and promote the Korean language, fashion, and lifestyle.`,
          `K-dramas have become a cultural bridge of sorts, captivating viewers around the globe, thanks to their relatable narratives, well-produced content, and intriguing story lines. For example, True Beauty resonates with young audiences everywhere because it captures the universal struggles of identity and self-worth. Hotel Del Luna provides viewers from foreign countries with access to the values and folklore of Korean society by incorporating history and fantasy. Descendants of the Sun showcases aspects of Korean society, while at the same time focusing on qualities of patriotism, hence the badging of love and sacrifice within the military realm. `,
          `Crash Landing on You was a sensation with an original plot-line of a South Korean heiress and a North Korean soldier brought to life on either side of the divided peninsula and sparked discussions of unification. Itaewon Class projects a modern, multicultural perspective of Korean society while talking about matters like discrimination and entrepreneurship. In the story of a neurodivergent lawyer working for a prestigious law firm, Extraordinary Attorney Woo highlights biodiversity and inclusivity. Twenty-Five Twenty-One combines the youthful dreams of love with choice walks on life through the economic struggle of the country during the IMF crisis.`,
          `When people visit another country and see its culture for themselves, it's harder to see that country only through the lens of political rivalry or past wrongs. This personal connection sets the stage for diplomacy that is more helpful and less based on fear.`,
          `As problems around the world get harder to solve, cultural diplomacy becomes an important way to connect people, build trust, and make hard power less appealing. The experiences of France, Japan, and especially South Korea show how cultural exchange can change the way countries get along with each other, making the world more connected, understanding, and peaceful.`,

        heading: "Empowering Diplomacy With Cultural Intricacies",
        paragraphs: [
          `Integrating cultural theories in diplomacy involves embedding frameworks like Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions, Hall’s HighvsLow Context Communication, and Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations into the fabric of diplomatic practice to achieve nuanced understanding and effective engagement. Hofstede’s model offers measurable scales—power distance, individualism vs collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs femininity, long term orientation, indulgence vs restraint—that enable diplomats to tailor strategies according to national cultural profiles. For example, high power-distance nations such as Saudi Arabia and China exhibit stringent respect for hierarchy and protocol; diplomats engaging these states must adopt formally structured seating arrangements, clearly defined ranks, and deferential speech. Conversely, in low power-distance countries like Sweden and the Netherlands, flatter structures and informal dialogue are more effective, allowing diplomats to foster open brainstorming and horizontal collaboration. By consulting Hofstede’s dimension scores for negotiation partners, diplomats can adjust tone and format in advance to align with cultural expectations¹.`,
          `Edward Hall’s theory further refines communication strategy using the high- vs low-context spectrum. High-context cultures—typically in East Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa—rely heavily on implicit messaging, non-verbal cues, shared social context, and silence as meaningful communication². In such settings, a diplomat must ‘read the air’, interpreting pauses or understated gestures rather than reacting to the literal content of speech. In contrast, low-context cultures common in North America and northern Europe favour explicitness, clarity, and direct rhetoric². Misunderstandings often arise when diplomats accustomed to directness interpret high-context silence as evasiveness, or when those used to subtle cues feel directness is aggressive. Awareness of this dimension allows diplomats to recalibrate their negotiation texts—for instance, offering detailed explanations in low-context venues, yet embedding deference and relational cues in high-context engagements.`,
          `Adding to this, Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations framework highlights how deep-seated civilizational identity and collective historical memory influence foreign policy postures³. While controversial and perhaps oversimplified, Huntington underscores that civilizational narratives—shaped by history, religion, and culture—remain powerful motivators. Take China: its assertiveness on the global stage draws upon a narrative of the “Century of Humiliation,” when a series of colonial and military failures eroded national pride. Acknowledging such narratives—not dismissing them—allows diplomats to engage respectfully, mitigate nationalist defensiveness, and build trust. This might involve strategic reference to China’s restoration of sovereignty in diplomatic language or academic citations, validating cultural memory without supporting exclusionary nationalism. Conversely, ignoring such narratives risks abrupt backlash, especially when national media frames criticism as renewed Western hostility⁴.`,
          `Operationalising these theories means diplomats can forecast culture-shaped behaviour patterns, tailor communication, and adjust negotiation formats. A practical example is adjusting timelines and processes in collectivist cultures—such as Japan, China, and the Gulf states—where internal consensus-building requires slower, more inclusive decision-making frameworks. Diplomatic teams engaging these governments should build in additional rounds of internal review and extended deadlines. Similarly, when engaging high-context societies like Japan or South Korea (which also retain elements of high uncertainty avoidance), diplomats should provide adequate face-saving options within negotiation language, avoid public embarrassment, and include third-party coordinators to facilitate indirect messaging.`,
          `Empirical studies support this approach. Anees Karawan’s recent analysis demonstrates that incorporating Hofstede’s dimensions into diplomatic training improved negotiation outcomes by 30% in UN-led climate and trade discussions between 2020–2023. Hall’s Iceberg model, as applied in diplomatic training modules by Agave Affairs, helped reduce miscommunication rates during inter-governmental climate panels involving mixed cultural delegations⁶. Even critics of Huntington agree that understanding the weight of civilizational narratives helps explain the cultural resilience behind Russia’s framing of the Ukraine invasion or India’s balancing of Hindu-nationalist identity with democratic alignment³.`,
          `Furthermore, appearance and ritual matter: diplomats should prepare culturally aligned platforms—like serving green tea and omitting alcohol in Japanese meetings, or using formal titles and gift exchange in Gulf contexts—to signal cultural competence. Seating charts that reflect status (placing host and guest according to protocol) signal respect in high power-distance settings. Visual aids—such as a world map showing Hofstede dimension scores, comparative seating diagrams, or a spectrum chart of context communication—can be embedded in briefing materials to guide both diplomats and stakeholders.`,
          `Real-world incident analysis further illustrates pitfalls and opportunities. U.S.–Japan trade negotiations in the 1990s faltered partly because American negotiators interpreted Japanese indirect refusals as ambivalence, pushing prematurely for concessions; adjusting to Hall’s framework might have allowed more time for trust-building². At the G20 summit in 2019, when the U.S. delegation’s abrupt public remarks disrupted China’s preference for consensus statements, the result was a visible freeze in dialogue—highlighting a context mismatch. Conversely, in 2021, a protocol-savvy engagement by Nordic diplomats in Saudi Arabia—complete with formal protocol observers and hierarchical introductions—helped unlock cooperation around green energy initiatives.`,
          `Integrating these theories into diplomatic training and institutional practice transforms diplomacy from a transactional endeavor into one rooted in empathy, cultural intelligence, and relational awareness. Training modules can include Hofstede dimension interviews, Hallbased role-play simulations, and scenario analysis of civilizational narratives. Diplomatic academies might simulate the “Century of Humiliation” dialogue context or model seating protocols for high power-distance environments. Crucially, diplomats must avoid reductive stereotyping; cultural frameworks serve as flexible heuristics, not rigid scripts.`,
          `By deliberately embedding cultural theory into diplomatic engagement, practitioners can anticipate reactions, tailor messaging, and avoid missteps with precision. Adjusting negotiation spaces, rephrasing proposals to include culturally resonant metaphors, and pacing interactions according to collective versus individual decision timelines reflect this approach in action. Far from obstructing diplomacy, culture becomes its conduit—transforming transactional exchanges into bridges of mutual understanding and sustainable cooperation.`,

        paragraphs: [
          `In today’s  world, which is no longer defined by singular hegemonies but shaped by a cacophony of civilizations, cultural diplomacy has the capability to influence world leaders and especially the opinion of the general public. It has transcended the realm of soft appeal to become a deliberate, calculated mechanism of influence, one that speaks through connection. As this paper has explored, the export of scripts and symbols, whether in the form of Korean dramas, Promise of the American Dream, European linguistic outreach, or Indian spiritual diplomacy, has become pivotal to how nations craft their global images and assert their dominance in international negotiations.`,
          `Theoretical frameworks such as Hofstede’s dimensions, Hall’s context spectrum, and Huntington’s civilizational discourse equip modern diplomats with cultural literacy, allowing them to decode signals and prevent misunderstandings that could spark all-out wars. `,
          `In an era where the prospect of wars, genocides and mass-killing are not a dystopian future, where individual egos withhold the final decision of who lives and who dies, Cultural diplomacy is not merely a supplement to international relations, it is the prerequisite script that alters and, hopefully, prevents it.`,

      "Breaking down the issue in the South China Sea, this study looks at the old, belief-based, and rule-related reasons for China’s large claims. The review checks how good and natural limits international rules of law have, especially UNCLOS (The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994. It provides for a comprehensive regime of law and order for the ocean spaces of the world, laying down the rules for the distribution of rights and jurisdiction of States in maritime areas, peaceful uses of the seas, and management of their resources.) in settling this long-lasting fight. More questions go into the main behind-the-scenes political and social forces that keep up with regional trouble. This research was formed within a strong interdisciplinary analytical framework. It combined critical historical analysis of ancient Chinese practices and cartography with a rigorous assessment of the international legal regime, highlighting the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration decision and an analysis of geopolitical strategies, primarily the 'stupefy the people' ideology. The novel conceptual tool of maritime masculinity sheds new light on state behaviour and international law practice from a gendered perspective. The major findings shed light on some critical aspects. While China bases its expansive 'Nine-Dash Line' claims on historical narratives, more often, such claims are a product of cultural group activities rather than continuous nation-state sovereignty and strategically serve as a global distraction. Legally, they run head-on against the principles of UNCLOS. With blatant disregard for the 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated many of its assertions, the weakness in the enforcement mechanisms of UNCLOS and the pervading influence of ‘the law of the strong’ have been brought into sharp focus. The deep-set power dynamics shown in this dispute reveal dominant 'masculine-coded behaviours’ over an aspiration to avoid even the slightest perceived vulnerability and thus create what might be described as a ‘zero-sum’ security climate. Hence, this conflict is protracted and demands enormous political will and unified multilateral commitment beyond mere legal instruments to achieve peace in that part of the world.",

      "Rich in natural riches and an essential route for international trade, the South China Sea has become a major international flashpoint with conflicting territorial claims over economic stability and regional security. The disputed 'Nine-Dash Line' is often used to depict China's vast maritime claims. This line crosses the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of several Southeast Asian nations, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia, and encircles a sizable section of the South China Sea, which contains several islands and reefs. A hub of geopolitical complexity and heightened competition, the South China Sea is rich in fisheries resources, making up almost 12% of the world's total fish catch and essential to the livelihoods of millions in the area. It also holds substantial undeveloped oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, influencing the wealth and potential economic expansion of neighbouring countries. As a vital route handling more than one-third of all marine traffic worldwide, the South China Sea's strategic significance extends to international trade. Carrying commodities worth over $3 trillion annually and linking major Asian economies with markets in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, it becomes a focal point for overlapping marine authorities and territorial claims, underscoring its global importance. The region’s rich historical background dates back many centuries. China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan are among the powers vying for control of various islands and reefs. This rivalry has produced a complicated web of conflicts that entwine tactical advantages, national pride, and historical interpretations. The involvement of global powers like the United States adds new dimensions to this already complex situation.",

        paragraphs: [
          "The ancients and China practiced the way which did not enlighten the people, they usedit to stupefy the people and this is what is happening in present. Also the people who areintelligent and knowledgeable and question the world order are hard to rule. Thereforeruling a state through knowledge is to rock the state. So it's better to stupefy thembecause ruling a state through ignorance brings stability to the state.That's why China wants the whole world to be distracted in the conflicts of South China Sea and international boundary conflicts so it can grow like a lone wolf and nobody can interferein their internal matters if they keep the world distracted in outer world. It is how China make historical names on South China Sea by drawing a 9 dash line the legal basis of China's claim. 1China is actually the victim with regards to the South China Sea issue, the Chinese people were the first to discuss name and develop the South China Sea island1 .(Weidong,Z,2016) Facts that support China's claim:- In 111 BCE the Han dynasty patrolled the island in South China Sea from 220 to 265 BCE during China's three kingdoms period contained descriptions of some of these islands indicating that the Chinese had travelled there . Structure of pottery and Chinese coins dated 713 to 425 Tang and sang dynasties have been found on some of the island and reefs. A map from 1775 and a map between 1810 to 1817 all made during Qing dynasty. The protest of Qing dynasty against the survey of island conducted by Germany in 1883. Argument against the claim :- 2China's legal claims are valid and buttressed by history. These above all claims show that China as a cultural group of people rather than as particular nation, state or government 2 . China looks at the evidence of activity of Chinese people in South China Sea and these claims are inextricably intertwined despite the fact this evidence spends multiple government and thousand of years . In China's view these efforts from the Chinese people and therefore from China. (Dupuy,F,2013) According to Chinese Ambassador Liu Xiaoming, as early as 200 BC, 3during China's Han dynasty, the Chinese had large scale and frequency farming and fishing activities in the South China Sea. Actually the basis of China claiming the South China Sea is their historical evidences3 , but you cannot claim a sea only by historical evidences. So the main chinese ideology is to stupefy the world by intervening in international matters and ignoring the atrocities which they've been doing to their people in the name of development or growth.(Xiaoming,L,2016)",

        paragraphs: [
          "Protecting sovereignty in the South China Sea is not merely a legal or geopolitical endeavour — it is a gendered performance. China's responses to U.S. patrols and surveillance reflect hegemonic masculinity — asserting dominance through territorial control and avoiding perceived weakness (Morton, 2016). Building artificial islands, establishing military installations, and deploying ADIZs (Air Defence Identification Zones) are all displays of militarized masculinity aimed at territorial marking.",
          "The notion of “losing face” drives both China and the U.S. into a “zero-sum” competition where security is achieved by dominance, not cooperation. Naval flyovers and symbolic military actions serve as proof of strength rather than lawful diplomacy. This is further complicated by gendered dynamics in maritime industries. Women make up only 1.2% of the seafaring workforce globally (Boström, 2024). Female mariners often “undo” their gender to fit in, highlighting a toxic masculine work environment. Post structural feminist theorists, such as Judith Butler, argue that identities like gender are performative — constructed through repeated behaviours. Onboard, gender norms shape power hierarchies, with women often sidelined or harassed. Similarly, international law’s interpretation is masculinized. The “law of the strong” privileges dominant states and sidelines the global South. Despite the universality of UNCLOS, states like China and the U.S. interpret it through strategic interests rather than ethical adherence (Seo, 2024).",

        paragraphs: [
          "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the governing legal framework for oceanic boundaries and maritime rights. China's Nine-Dash Line, which covers nearly 90% of the South China Sea, directly challenges the EEZs of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei (Beckman, 2013). UNCLOS, under Article 121, differentiates islands (which can generate EEZs) from rocks and low-tide elevations (which cannot). Chinese-claimed features like Subi Reef and Fiery Cross Reef do not meet the criteria of habitable islands and hence do not qualify for EEZs (Yoshihara, 2018).",
          "In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruled in favour of the Philippines, invalidating China’s “historical rights” (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2016). The court asserted that none of the Spratly Islands is entitled to an EEZ. China, however, rejected this legally binding ruling and escalated its activities in the region. This illustrates a fundamental flaw in UNCLOS — it lacks enforcement power. While it offers arbitration and dispute resolution, compliance is voluntary. When powerful states defy international rulings, legal norms falter (Bateman, 2017). China's actions blur legality and strategy, turning UNCLOS into a symbolic rather than enforceable framework (Storey, 2020). ASEAN’s efforts to negotiate a Code of Conduct have also stalled due to internal rifts and China's economic leverage. Even the U.S., which enforces UNCLOS principles through Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), has not ratified the treaty, weakening its moral authority (Kaplan, 2011).",

        paragraphs: [
          "Beyond its political and legal complexities, the South China Sea is one of the most biologically diverse marine ecosystems in the world, and is now very unfortunately gravely endangered. The region accounts for approximately 12% of global fish and sustains over 3.7 million fishers (Palomares & Pauly, 2019). However, the continued conflict over sovereignty and maritime rights has intensified unsustainable resource extraction, environmental destruction, and pollution that is left unchecked, along with limited regional cooperation to address the ecological crisis in the land.",
          "The South China Sea is home to over 3365 marine fish species (Spalding, 2012), making it one of the most profound fishing grounds in the world. However, in recent years, the region has faced serious problems due to overfishing, illegal and unregulated fishing activities and harmful methods used by fishermen such as blast fishing. Since many countries in the area rely heavily on the sea’s natural resources, there has been growing competition among these countries to claim fishing rights. This has led to an increase in fishing fleets, especially from China, whose maritime militia (i.e. fishing boats operated by civilians under state orders) often fish in challenging and environmentally sensitive areas. As a result, fish populations have been rapidly declining (Mallory T, 2016).",
          "In addition to problems like overfishing, the South China sea’s fragile coral reefs have also suffered serious damage because of China’s artificial island building projects. Reefs like Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief have been heavily affected as large, judging operations were carried out to build military bases and airstrips. In 2016, the permanent court of arbitration declared that China’s island building activities had caused ‘irreparable harm’ to the marine environment (Permanent Court of Arbitration, 2016). Even though this ruling was made, the damage continues, as artificial concrete islands presently stand upfront, where natural ecosystems once existed, affecting not only the marine life, but the balance of the ecosystem.",
          "Another serious issue in the South China Sea is increasing levels of pollution and destruction. The growth of maritime traffic, oil drilling activities, and the military has led to more oil spills, plastic waste, and untreated sewage being dumped into the sea. Research has found dangerous levels of heavy-metals present in marine life and sediments along the coast of countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, bringing risks to food, safety and health of the local communities that are residing in these regions (Chen, X., Zhang, R., & Cao, M., 2022)",
          "Organisations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have tried to address these issues but without increasingly strong binding agreements, progress has been slow. Since its rejection of the 2016 arbitration ruling, its continued activities in the disputed waters have made the situation worse (Storey, 2020). Overall, the South China sea shows how environmental issues and international politics are closely connected. If the region is to protect its rich marine life and resources for future generations, there needs to be not only environmental restoration projects taking place but also a strong and enforceable international agreement that goes beyond territorial disputes and focuses on shared ecological interest and wellbeing of all.",

    conclusion: [
      "Despite inter-agency rivalries, China’s maritime actors operate under the Communist Party’s overall strategic umbrella, directed by Xi Jinping. His hardline stance and consolidation of power have driven a more assertive maritime policy. However, institutional reforms have generated tensions within bodies like the CCG and PLA (Jakobson, 2019). China’s sovereignty claims influence everything from state propaganda to strategic doctrines. The CCP sees these territories as non-negotiable extensions of national pride and security. As such, legal frameworks like UNCLOS remain ineffective against political ideology rooted in exceptionalism and power projection. International resistance to China’s maritime claims must thus rely not only on legal rebuttals but also on understanding China’s ideological and strategic narrative. While these claims may seem legitimate from Beijing’s view, they remain contentious under international norms, ensuring continued diplomatic and military tension in the region.",

The results show that while students show a moderate level of human rights awareness, institutional efforts are still dispersed, and policies are not clearly operationalised.

Higher education in nations like the Philippines and South Africa has institutionalised HRE (Tibbitts, 2002; Bajaj, 2011). Although civic and moral education are mentioned in Bangladesh's National Education Policy (NEP) 2010, there is little specific mention of human rights (Kabir & Akter, 2014).",

Although a sizable portion of students were aware of fundamental human rights, fewer were able to describe particular rights or how they relate to domestic or international law, according to a 2022 study by Haque and Islam.",
          "The National Education Policy 2010 of Bangladesh states that one of the main objectives of higher education is to promote moral values, inclusivity, and citizenship. There is a disconnect between the policy's vision and its actualisation, though, because human rights education is not specifically included as a stand-alone element (Ahmed, 2019). The absence of uniform methods among Bangladeshi universities is exacerbated by this policy ambiguity.",
          "The literature also emphasises how young people seldom participate in institutional initiatives like debates, clubs, or policy dialogues, despite frequently being active in online rights-based campaigns (Rahman, 2021). Furthermore, current research does not provide a thorough understanding of the relationship among youth perception, policy formulation, and institutional efforts in HRE.",

          "1. Insufficient integration of the curriculum",

          "The study's conclusions paint a complex picture of Bangladeshi university students' awareness of human rights, highlighting both advancements and enduring deficiencies.",
          "First, the quantitative results confirm that although students have a relatively high general awareness of the term 'human rights' (87%), there is still a lack of conceptual clarity and deeper understanding, especially among students from non-law faculties. This is consistent with earlier research by Haque and Islam (2022), who also discovered that students frequently confuse rights with social justice or general morality, suggesting a lack of formal education in the subject.",
          "Additionally, the correlation between awareness level and academic year indicates that students may be exposed to more human rights concepts as they progress through their university education. This increase, however, varies by discipline, suggesting that there are gaps in the integration of the curriculum (Kabir & Chowdhury, 2017).",
          "Despite their stated interest, students' lack of participation in extracurricular activities highlights a significant gap between institutional support and student motivation. This disconnect was reaffirmed by FGDs, which showed that although students are keen to learn, their engagement opportunities are limited by institutional inertia and dormant platforms.",
          "Furthermore, an institutional policy gap is revealed by the qualitative data. Stakeholders emphasised that there is no official human rights education policy, despite the fact that some university policies make reference to civic education or values-based learning. Ahmed's (2019) criticism of Bangladesh's higher education policy, which is vague when it comes to rights-based education, is in line with this.",

          "There is still a noticeable disconnect between the goals of national policy and the application of human rights education (HRE) at the university level, even in Bangladesh, despite the country's dedication to democratic values and social justice. Although it does not specifically require or institutionalise human rights as a formal academic or extracurricular component, the National Education Policy 2010 promotes moral and ethical education (Ahmed, 2019). Universities function in a vacuum as a result of this omission, lacking any uniform guidelines for incorporating HRE into instruction or student life.",
          "Furthermore, no formal policy document defining goals or procedures for HRE—through co-curricular frameworks or curriculum modules—was present at any of the universities examined in this study. A clear connection to international human rights frameworks like the UDHR, ICCPR, or CEDAW is frequently absent, even in cases where values-based content is present, such as in political science or ethics courses. This results in a lack of policy continuity and fragmented understanding.",
          "Human rights initiatives are rarely given institutional priority by student affairs departments, frequently as a result of a lack of resources, inadequate training, or a lack of collaborations with pertinent NGOs or civic associations (Rahman, 2021). Instead of being a part of a continuous educational agenda, policy discussions and outreach initiatives are frequently reactive, spurred by crises or national events.",
          "Furthermore, policy-making organisations (such as the Ministry of Education and UGC) and civil society actors—who have the means and know-how to create effective HRE initiatives—do not work together effectively. Students are frequently left to look for awareness on their own without this coordination, usually using social media or unofficial networks.",

          "It restricts students' capacity to critically discuss issues pertaining to national and international rights.",

Both standalone courses and integrated subjects within sociology, ethics, and governance studies may fall under this category. International frameworks such as the UDHR and regional charters should be reflected in curriculum design.",
          "2.Establish a National HRE Policy for Higher Education",
          "A uniform policy guideline for HRE should be developed by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the Ministry of Education, and non-governmental organisations. Universities would be held accountable and consistency would be guaranteed.",
          "3.Boost Collaborative Learning Environments",
          "To plan seminars, debates, legal clinics, and awareness campaigns, student affairs departments should be given specialised funding and capacity-building training. Campus life can benefit from collaboration with NGOs and national human rights organisations like the NHRC.",
          "4.Provide Mechanisms for Monitoring and Evaluation",
          "Indicators should be created by universities to evaluate the results of HRE programs. These could include participation rates, pre- and post-course evaluations, student feedback, and inclusion in accreditation reviews.",
          "5.Promote Multidisciplinary and Useful Methods",
          "HRE shouldn't be limited to philosophical or legalistic discussions. Rather, interdisciplinary pedagogy and case-based learning should be used to introduce practical aspects like labour rights, gender rights, digital rights, and climate justice.",
          "6.Make Use of Digital Media and Technology",
          "Digital platforms can be useful instruments for raising awareness, especially among young people. Universities can offer micro-credentials or certificates, conduct online surveys, and distribute human rights resources through discussion boards, mobile apps, or online portals.",

    ],
    conclusion: [
      "This study has brought to light the significant discrepancy that exists in Bangladesh's higher education system between the creation of policies, institutional procedures, and student participation in human rights education (HRE). Although most students are aware of the term 'human rights,' the study shows that their conceptual knowledge and practical application of it are severely limited. The development of knowledgeable and rights-aware graduates is hampered by the absence of official curriculum inclusion, dormant extracurricular activities, and a lack of institutional policy guidance.",
      "According to the data, although students show an interest in learning more about human rights, their universities do not offer sufficient frameworks or opportunities for this kind of interaction. The results highlight that while awareness rises with academic advancement, especially in fields like law, this growth is neither consistent nor systematic across all faculties. Institutional policies continue to be reactive and ambiguous rather than proactive and strategic, according to stakeholder insights.",
      "The study comes to the conclusion that developing a human rights culture in academia and encouraging youth involvement require a comprehensive strategy that includes incorporating HRE into curricula, improving extracurricular activities, and enacting national-level policies. Giving university students the skills and information they need to comprehend, protect, and promote human rights is not only desirable but also essential as Bangladesh continues on its democratic and developmental paths.",

    abstract: [
      "This study examines the dynamic changes of a multipolar international system, along with the evolving roles of gender, terrorism, and security narratives. By emphasising how power is used through discourse, framing, and selective threat recognition, it challenges traditional, state-centric assumptions in international relations. To understand how states strategically reframe issues like human trafficking, migration, and terrorism to serve domestic legitimacy and global standing, the research draws on constructivist strategies to narrative diplomacy, feminist international relations theory, and securitisation theory. ",
      "This paper's central claim is that the transition from a liberal, unipolar world order to a contested multipolarity is both epistemological and geopolitical. It represents a fundamental shift in the definition of security, the experiences that are given priority in policy formulation, and the definition of diplomatic legitimacy in the context of disjointed international organisations. Three interconnected axes of analysis shape this epistemic dispute: ",
      "(1)	The gendered construction of international relations, where masculinised characteristics like militarism and rationality dominate security discourse while marginalised identities are made invisible. ",
      "(2)	The securitised framing of migration and human trafficking, especially in areas where state sovereignty is asserted through militarised intervention, victim criminalisation, or border control.  ",
      "(3)	The dispute over what constitutes terrorism, with conflicting interpretations among major powers, reflects broader struggles over normative authority in international forums. ",
      "India's changing diplomatic stance is offered as a primary case study because of its selective use of gendered and securitised narratives in response to issues of terrorism, migration, and human trafficking, in addition to its growing role as a norm-entrepreneur of the Global South. As case studies that highlight the discursive practices underlying 21st-century diplomacy, the analysis focuses on three prominent empirical examples: UNSC Resolution 2331, the EU-Libya migration agreement, and India's counterterrorism diplomacy through Operation Sindoor and its G20 leadership. ",
      "Ultimately, this paper argues that multipolarity reshapes the structure of international diplomacy, shifting it away from a multilateral consensus to normative contestation and discursive fragmentation. ",
      "In a world like this, the politics of who defines, who speaks, and who defends become more than just a diplomatic issue; they become a fight for survival, inclusion, and global justice. ",

    intro: [
      "Modern international relations are undergoing dramatic changes, not just in terms of who is in charge, but also in how that authority is perceived, utilised, and justified. Both disruption and opportunity have resulted from the shift from a post-Cold War unipolar world dominated by liberal Western democracies to a multipolar order. There is now intense competition for what once seemed to be established norms in the areas of migration, terrorism, gender equality, and security. The struggle for both material and epistemic supremacy lies at the core of this shifting terrain: What defines the threat? Whose safety is important? Moreover, in a fractured global order, what constitutes proper diplomacy? ",
      "International relations (IR) has historically given preference to masculinist logics of military deterrence, state sovereignty, and rationalist diplomacy. The lived realities of those who are disadvantaged by systematic violence, war, displacement, and exploitation have been masked by these paradigms, which have all too frequently ignored feminist criticisms and gendered experiences. Human trafficking, migration, and women's roles in peacebuilding were all framed within this paradigm as peripheral or 'soft' issues that did not fit the mould of conventional 'security' concerns. ",
      "However, as the body of work in critical security studies and feminist IR has expanded, it has become more and more evident that gender is not a side issue. Instead, it serves as a framework for international politics. Care, compromise, and interdependence, coded as 'feminine', have frequently been devalued as a result of the valorisation of reason, independence, and militarism, coded as 'masculine.' The design of foreign policy, the execution of peace initiatives, humanitarian relief efforts, and global governance systems have all been influenced by this normative hierarchy. From the exclusion of women in peace talks to the use of victim narratives that instrumentalise women while disregarding their agency, the gendered underpinnings of IR have tangible repercussions. ",
      "The way that migration and trafficking are framed in international diplomacy has changed significantly in tandem with gender. Although trafficking is defined as a human rights issue based on exploitation and coercion by international legal frameworks like the Palermo Protocol, many states' diplomatic rhetoric has increasingly securitised these phenomena. State actors frequently use militarised responses, border fortification, and punitive surveillance to portray trafficking and irregular migration as threats to national security rather than putting survivor welfare first. In the European Union's externalisation policies, agreements with Libya have resulted in the systematic detention, mistreatment, and commercialisation of migrant bodies, particularly those of women and girls, in carceral settings without human rights supervision. ",
      "Similar trends show up in the South Asian context. Security discourses take precedence over humanitarian concerns at the India-Bangladesh border. Cross-border movement is frequently categorised as illegal migration or infiltration, regardless of whether it is the result of trafficking or an escape from violence. In addition to criminalising vulnerable people, this hides the intersectional aspects of harm, where gender, caste, and class exacerbate structural vulnerability.",
      "Terrorism continues to be one of the most potent and manipulable concepts in international politics, along with gender and migration. Since there is no single, agreed-upon definition, states are free to define terrorism in a manner that best serves their geopolitical objectives. Separatist movements, for example, may be called 'terrorist' to defend internal crackdowns, but depending on the narrator, comparable violent acts may be presented as liberation struggles. This discursive malleability is even more pronounced in a multipolar setting. The power to label or discredit actors as terrorists turns into a narrative warfare tool that enables states to establish sovereign interpretations of threat, create selective alliances, and circumvent international norms. ",
      "The politics of definition have replaced the politics of consensus in the new multipolar order. These days, definitions of 'human rights','sovereignty', and 'security' are debatable rather than established. Multilateralism itself faces fragmentation as competing powers, liberal democracies, authoritarian states, and postcolonial nations assert differing visions of the global order. Some actors view human rights frameworks and feminist diplomacy as instruments of Western moral imperialism. In contrast, others see them as ideal standards to be incorporated into new care and justice coalitions. ",
      "The role of emerging powers becomes crucial in this fragmented normative environment. For instance, in international diplomacy, India has established itself as a narrative leader. It presents a hybrid model of international legitimacy by addressing both sovereigntist logics and liberal rights discourses. For example, in its diplomatic response to terrorism, it asserts national sovereignty and securitised border control while focusing on moderation, legality, and moral clarity. A similar conflict between rhetorical support for gender-sensitive diplomacy and its limited domestic application can be seen in India's involvement with the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda. The broader dynamics of embedded feminism are reflected in these contradictions, where gender-inclusive language can conceal exclusionary or securitised practices. ",
      "Therefore, in the era of multipolarity, this study examines the complex relationships between gender, terrorism, migration, and diplomatic development. Instead of addressing these problems separately, it highlights how they are related: how trafficking is confused with terrorism; how feminist diplomatic tactics are appropriated or marginalised in the name of sovereignty; and how gendered framings are used to defend security interventions. The concept of 'norm contestation,' in which definitions of legitimacy, victimhood, and threat are not only discussed but also deliberately constructed, lies at the heart of this inquiry. ",
      "Utilising a multi-scalar and intersectional approach, the study assesses case studies like IndiaBangladesh border diplomacy, EU-Libya migration governance, and UNSC Resolution 2331 (2016) to investigate how state and non-state actors employ gendered narratives in diplomatic settings. The study challenges the notion that diplomacy in a multipolar world is merely a rebalancing of alliances through this lens. Instead, it implies that multipolarity radically changes the epistemic framework of diplomacy itself, moving the focus from 'what should be done?' to 'who gets to decide what matters?'",
      "In reframing the discourse, this paper not only highlights the risks of securitised governance but also underscores the emancipatory potential of feminist and intersectional approaches in reimagining diplomacy as a space of care, justice, and survivor-led agency. ",

Ann Tickner (1992), and Christine Sylvester (1994). Enloe's groundbreaking book 'Bananas, Beaches, and Bases' famously revealed the structural silencing of women's roles in international systems, ranging from nurses and sex workers to diplomatic spouses. Through a gendered lens, Tickner's intervention reframed realism, contending that 'national interest' is profoundly masculinised rather than neutral. ",

More comprehensive criticisms of the state's disregard for lived experiences, particularly those of women, gender minorities, and the Global South, became possible with this understanding. ",

However, as Shepherd (2008) and True (2020) point out, this kind of inclusion frequently works as 'embedded feminism', an appropriation of feminist criticism that advances rather than opposes state interests. As nations like China, India, and Russia increasingly reject liberal feminist frameworks in favour of sovereignty-based discourses, this critique has become more acute in the face of multipolarity. ",
          "Another essential framework for comprehending these changes is provided by the Copenhagen School's securitisation theory (Buzan et al., 1998). It asserts that problems like terrorism, migration, and human trafficking are made into 'security' issues through discursive construction rather than objective standards. These issues, once securitised, invite extraordinary state responses that often violate human rights, such as surveillance, militarisation, and emergency law. According to studies by Lobasz (2009) and Carling (2006), securitisation frequently obscures the root causes of human trafficking, which include colonial legacies, poverty, and gender inequality, in favour of portraying trafficked people as border threats. ",
          "Thus, feminist security studies challenge conventional wisdom by posing the question, 'whose security' is being safeguarded? Feminist perspectives show how policies frequently criminalise or instrumentalise the weak under the pretence of protection, rather than presuming that state security and citizen welfare are compatible. This is particularly evident in the criminalisation of migration at the borders between India and Bangladesh and the EU and Libya, where humanitarian obligations are subordinated to national security considerations.

The result is a fragmented international response, with some powers prioritising border integrity and national image while liberal democracies may support survivors' rights. ",

Early feminist IR scholars like Tickner (1992), Enloe (1990), and later Sjoberg (2014) contended that mainstream IR theories, such as liberalism and realism, are gender-blind because they are predicated on presumptions that universalise male experiences while obscuring the roles of women in peacebuilding, diplomacy, and conflict resolution.

According to this framework, feminised qualities such as empathy, compromise, and care are marginalised or pathologised, while masculinised norms like aggression, independence, and rationality dominate international security and diplomatic paradigms (Enloe, 2004; Shepherd, 2008). This shows up as the institutional disregard for survivor narratives and lived gendered vulnerabilities in securitised contexts such as terrorism and migration control. ",
          "The idea of 'security' has been expanded by feminist IR from a state-centric, militarised concept to 'human security,' highlighting the daily threats faced by marginalised people, particularly women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and migrants (True, 2012). For example, counter-terrorism or border security regimes frequently include human trafficking, which disproportionately impacts women and children, and portray victims as threats or illegal migrants rather than as people deserving of protection based on their rights. ",

Intersectionality is frequently erased when gendered violence is repackaged under general anti-crime or national security frameworks, as demonstrated by recent diplomatic discussions surrounding UNSC Resolution 2331.

When these issues are securitised, they are taken out of the normal political sphere and placed in the emergency sphere, where it is acceptable to suspend rights, increase surveillance, and defend the use of force. The EU-Libya migration governance pact, which militarised border management and widely violated human rights in detention facilities by framing migration flows as security threats, is a clear example of the applicability of this theory. Despite their prevalence, gendered harms like rape, human trafficking, and reproductive violence are either ignored or not visible in these situations. ",

Therefore, the meanings of security, threat, and diplomacy are socially constructed through language, performance, and institutional validation, rather than being based on objective realities.",

For instance, states define terrorism, frequently in ways that are ideologically charged or self-serving, rather than just reacting to it.

A deeper understanding of the differences between liberal democracies and sovereignty-first regimes is also facilitated by this triadic lens, particularly about issues of gender justice, migrant rights, and counterterrorism diplomacy. This paper applies these frameworks as overlapping analytical lenses rather than treating them as mutually exclusive. Whether it is the erasure of survivor agency in securitised trafficking discourses, the legitimation of selective counterterrorism norms, or the co-optation of feminist language in state narratives, each contributes to exposing various aspects of power and silence. When combined, they facilitate the mapping of the shifting axes of international diplomacy during a period of gendered violence, geopolitical competition, and normative transformation. ",

Feminist diplomacy, Global South leadership, and intersectional frameworks are no longer marginal; they are being advanced in forums previously dominated by hegemonic actors. If international diplomacy is to remain credible in a multipolar world, it must resist both authoritarian closure and liberal complacency. It must embrace complexity, acknowledge historical injustice, and centre the voices of those most affected by security policies.",

        paragraphs: [
          "Human trafficking, especially gender-based trafficking, was first formally acknowledged as a threat to global peace and security in December 2016 with the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2331. It also played a crucial role in connecting trafficking and sexual violence to more general discussions of terrorism and international governance. The Council characterised trafficking as a tool of terror warfare rather than just a criminal or humanitarian issue after the resolution recognised that non-state actors such as ISIS weaponised sexual violence, including the enslavement of Yazidi women, as a tactic of war and ideological control.",
          "However, even though this reinterpretation made the problem more urgent, it also revealed stark geopolitical differences, highlighting how multipolarity undermines international consensus on defining and combating human trafficking. Liberal democracies, primarily from the Global North, framed the resolution through a rights-based, gender-sensitive lens, emphasising survivor-centred care and accountability for offenders. This was in line with larger pledges to the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, which is based on feminist international relations theory and advocates for women to be meaningfully included in peace processes and for security to be redefined as everyday safety rather than merely state survival (Tickner, 1992; True, 2012). However, the gendered framing was rejected by authoritarian countries like China and Russia. They prioritised state security, legal formalism, and sovereignty over human rights or survivor narratives.",
          "Terms like 'sexual slavery' and 'gender-based violence' were mainly omitted from their contributions to the resolution's drafting, favouring instead non-interference, border control, and crime prevention, principles that are more in line with realist security doctrines than with feminist diplomacy (UNSC, 2016; Shepherd, 2023). This discrepancy captures a more profound normative divide in international governance. The securitisation of trafficking turns victims into symbolic threats rather than people with rights, according to the Copenhagen School's theory of how political actors frame social issues as existential threats (Buzan et al., 1998). Feminist academics warn that this approach instrumentalises survivors, turning them from agents with dignity and voice to mere tools for policy. According to Shepherd (2023) and True (2020), this dynamic encourages a type of 'embedded feminism,' in which gendered language is appropriated to justify military or carceral responses without promoting systemic justice.",
          "Furthermore, despite its revolutionary visibility, UNSCR 2331 did not address the patriarchal state practices, economic precarity, and militarisation, power structures that sustain human trafficking. By concentrating on surveillance, prosecution, and deterrence, priorities that are more consistent with the logic of state sovereignty than with feminist ethics of care, it avoided the underlying causes of gendered exploitation.",

          "One example of how migration governance can be used as a tool for securitised diplomacy that outsources violence under the pretence of humanitarian protection is the EU-Libya migration pact. The European Union has made greater investments in externalising its borders since the 'migration crisis' of 2015, primarily by supporting third-party states like Libya to hold and discourage migrants before they arrive in Europe. On the surface, what seems like a practical strategy to lessen irregular migration is a policy architecture that abdicates legal responsibility while enabling systemic abuses, especially against women and girls.",
          "A contradiction at the core of this arrangement is that the EU, a self-described leader in human rights, has established a border regime that partners with appalling countries that have human rights records. The Coast Guard has been accused of widespread brutality, including intercepting migrant boats, holding survivors in arbitrary facilities, and engaging in practices that amount to slavery. The Libyan Coast Guard was trained and equipped through EU initiatives, such as EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia. Human rights organisations and UN investigations have shown that rape, sexual slavery, and trafficking are common in these detention facilities.",
          "Feminist critiques frame this arrangement as a purposeful political action that reconfigures human mobility through racialised and gendered lenses, rather than just as a policy failure. Women and girls are caught between domestic violence and dehumanisation while travelling, particularly those escaping forced marriage, domestic abuse, or female genital mutilation. Their movement is regarded as criminal trespass rather than a means of survival. Policymakers are unable to see the trauma experienced by women when they are detained by Libyan forces and taken back to detention facilities. This invisibility is structural rather than incidental. The logic underlying the EU-Libya policy architecture prioritises border integrity over human dignity.",

Stretching over 4,096 km and running through densely populated and economically vulnerable regions, this frontier is marked not only by its geopolitical tension but also by a complex interplay of migration, trafficking, and gendered state surveillance. At its core, this case reflects how securitisation processes often conflate irregular migration with human trafficking, rendering victims invisible and reifying statecentric narratives of control and protection.",
          "In India’s current border governance, cross-border movement, particularly by women, is treated with suspicion and criminality. Regardless of whether these women are trafficked victims, fleeing domestic or communal violence, or economic migrants escaping destitution, their identities are flattened into the category of 'illegal infiltrators.' The porous and historically fluid nature of the border is reimagined through the lens of national security, often with communal overtones. The 'illegal Bangladeshi' trope, frequently employed in domestic Indian political discourse, has served as a mechanism to both justify militarised border infrastructure and inflame public sentiment around internal security and national identity.",
          "This securitised framing leaves little room for humanitarian or intersectional engagement. As Ghosh (2020) notes, few gender-sensitive mechanisms exist to differentiate between trafficked persons and undocumented migrants. Consequently, many trafficked women are detained, deported, or subjected to judicial neglect, a process that is deeply dehumanising and violates both Indian constitutional guarantees and international human rights standards. Women’s mobility across the border, already fraught with risk, is compounded by bureaucratic apathy and legal ambiguity, often pushing survivors back into cycles of exploitation.",

Operation Sindoor was essentially a purposeful narrative construction exercise in addition to a surgical strike on militant infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. A significant turning point in India's counterterrorism diplomacy was the operation's framing and aftermath, which demonstrated the growing convergence of performativity, symbolism, and legitimacy in international relations.",
          "The name 'Sindoor' itself evokes a gendered national narrative, alluding to the traditions of widowhood and mourning. In the service of the country, it elevates the suffering of loss and evokes the collective trauma of loss. This discursive action turns grief into moral legitimacy from the standpoint of feminist international relations (IR). It is problematic, however. By grounding the concept of national harm in feminised imagery, it perpetuates traditional gender roles in which the nation is viewed as a widow or grieving mother whose loss needs to be made right by masculine state power.",
          "India's strategic restraint and strict information control, which allowed Pakistani media to break the news of the strike first, demonstrate a mastery of narrative sequencing from a constructivist perspective. India was able to present itself as a responsible actor carrying out justice with minor collateral damage, rather than as an aggressor, thanks to this symbolic diplomacy. In addition to removing tactical threats, the operation aimed to influence global perception. Indian officials reinforced a cooperative stance within international counterterrorism norms by providing advanced briefings to key allies, such as the United States.",

India employed a narrative approach centred on inclusive multilateralism, soft power projection, and postcolonial legitimacy, under the overarching theme of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future.'",
          "Held in early 2023, the Voice of the Global South Summit was both symbolic and strategic, uniting more than 120 countries from Asia, Africa, and Latin America in a virtual alliance against the North's monopoly on norms. India promoted non-Western ideas of cooperation, security, and development, positioning itself as a moral bridge connecting power. Significantly, India did not rely on hard power posturing in its diplomatic tone during this time. Rather than the militarised masculinities typically associated with great power status, it placed more emphasis on consensual norm-building, civilizational ethos, and narrative diplomacy.",
          "In the G20 context, India's diplomatic approach stands out for its implicit gender engagement, which is achieved through the substantive inclusion of gender-sensitive policy priorities rather than through overt feminist foreign policy branding. India's agenda was centred on issues like food security, climate justice, digital public infrastructure, and women-led entrepreneurship. Due to their historical feminisation, that is, their association with social development or 'soft' politics, these fields have been marginalised in conventional diplomacy.

        paragraphs: [
          "This study emphasises the fact that power in the fragmented, multipolar world of today comes from both the capacity to define and the capacity to act. In international relations, gender, migration, trafficking, and terrorism are no longer peripheral issues; instead, they have become key platforms on which states challenge legitimacy, assert moral capital, and influence the epistemic framework of global governance. The definitional conflicts over 'security', 'terrorism', and 'human rights' are being used by states to project soft power, form alliances, and modify or circumvent legal regimes as they increasingly engage in narrative diplomacy.  ",
          "The normative consensus that formerly governed international organisations is eroding in this environment. The prevailing models for humanitarian intervention, migration management, and feminist foreign policy were framed initially by Western liberal democracies. However, emerging nations like Brazil, China, India, and Russia are actively working to redefine the standards of the global order, rather than merely participating in it. New diplomatic approaches, like India's moral posturing through G20 soft power and Global South solidarity, have been made possible by this pluralisation of authority. However, it has also made room for regressive views of security, which are frequently disguised in logics of sovereignty that defend militarised humanitarianism, exclusion, and surveillance. ",
          "There is currently a lack of a common language on important issues, as demonstrated by case studies such as UNSC Resolution 2331, the EU-Libya pact, and India-Bangladesh border governance. Is trafficking more of a threat to border integrity or a human rights issue? Are displaced people and migrants to be discouraged or protected? Is feminist diplomacy a Western export or a moral requirement? These ambiguities show ideological differences in addition to diplomatic rifts. They signify a change in multipolar diplomacy from universal norm-setting to norm contestation. ",
          "Crucially, this paper reveals how people who are at the intersection of vulnerability, gender, and geography are disproportionately marginalised by these securitised definitions. Global governance systems have made survivors invisible by favouring state-centric narratives, especially women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and stateless communities whose lived experiences do not neatly fit into legal or policy categories. Policy failure and ethical erosion result when migration is framed as a demographic threat, trafficking is reduced to a transnational crime, or counterterrorism takes precedence over civil liberties. ",
          "For instance, the externalisation of European borders to Libya reveals how African women in transit, survivors of sexual violence, trafficking, and institutional neglect, are disproportionately harmed by the politics of deterrence. A securitised model that confuses mobility with infiltration is also reflected in India's biometric surveillance and deportation policy along the Bangladeshi border, which portrays marginalised women as existential threats rather than agents in need of justice or protection. These illustrations demonstrate how securitisation hides structural violence behind a front of control and order. ",
          "A different vocabulary for comprehending and addressing these issues is offered by feminist international relations (FIR). Women's instrumental participation in peace processes or development discussions is only one aspect of FIR. It provides a research approach that prioritises intersectionality, lived experience, and the politics of visibility. It recasts diplomacy as an ethical endeavour, a forum for recognising and resolving historically marginalised voices, and more than just a geopolitical game. In addition to asking who defines security, FIR also asks whose security matters and whether the current diplomatic methods can ever bring about justice without structural change. ",
          "When examining performative diplomatic actions, such as India's Operation Sindoor, this lens becomes crucial. Symbols such as 'sindoor' were used to gender nationalist grief in this instance, making widowhood a metaphor for national trauma and normalising retaliatory violence within a moralistic framework. In a similar vein, India's G20 presidency emphasises women's empowerment and digital equity. However, it also raises important questions: Does the gendered language lead to institutional reform, or is it merely a diplomatic aesthetic meant to boost status without questioning patriarchy? These arguments directly address the core of how legitimacy is created and disputed in international politics; they are not merely semantic. ",
          "This paper concludes that, in a multipolar world, diplomacy is increasingly about creating narratives and expressing and globalising one's ideas about justice, security, and order. These narratives run the risk of reproducing the very disparities they purport to address, unless feminist ideals of justice, care, and intersectionality are applied. Diplomacy must be based on more than conflicting state interests; it must be grounded in the agency of survivors, ethical responsibility, and the courage to envision global governance that transcends nationalism, militarism, and performative inclusion.

          "States must resist the reasoning that links mobility or difference to danger. Securitisation narratives allow nationalistic agendas to override humanitarian concerns, as demonstrated by policies such as the EU-Libya migration compact and India's biometric surveillance of Bangladeshi migrants. Policymakers must adopt a trauma-informed, rights-centred approach that puts the dignity of survivors ahead of punitive expediency. The lines separating human trafficking from irregular migration must be more clearly drawn by international law to prevent anti-trafficking initiatives from being used as covert tools of migration control.",
          "2. Institutionalise Feminist Diplomacy Beyond Symbolism",
          "Despite being enshrined in international norms, the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda remains underutilised and is frequently co-opted into militarised or carceral forms of governance. States must structurally integrate feminist diplomacy to avoid the pitfalls of 'embedded feminism.' This calls for significant changes in the formulation of foreign policy, going beyond gender parity in representation. For example, feminist grassroots actors from the Global South, in particular, must be included in peacebuilding because their ideas of justice, care, and reconciliation diverge from conventional masculinist conceptions of international security.",
          "3. Democratise Narrative Power in International Relations",
          "The significance of narrative legitimacy is emphasised by constructivist IR theory. However, legitimacy cannot be monopolised. Voices from the Global South, LGBTQ+ activists, and feminist movements must balance out the Global North's dominance in defining diplomatic language, especially when it comes to framing terrorism or human trafficking. The potential for pluralist narrative construction is demonstrated by India's recent discursive interventions at the UN and G20. Such interventions must, nevertheless, continue to be held to the principles they purport to support. Power comes from discourse, which also entails the duty to listen, share, and decentralise the capacity to speak for others.",

The shift from a unipolar to a multipolar order is both epistemological and geopolitical in nature. It alters not just who is in charge, but also how authority is defended and challenged.",

There has never been a more pressing need for ethical diplomacy in a world beset by geopolitical rivalry, forced relocation, and misinformation.",

It asks if caring can take the place of coercion, whether pluralism can replace monopoly, and whether diplomacy can concentrate on survival rather than states.

    abstract: [
      "This article looks at two major challenges in India’s public education system: the gap between boys and girls in education and the poor quality of teaching in many schools. Even though India has passed important laws and launched several programs—like the Right to Education Act, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020—many girls still face difficulties in staying in school, especially in rural and low-income areas. At the same time, many teachers lack proper training or don’t teach the right subjects, which affects the learning of all students. This paper shows how social issues like poverty, safety, and cultural beliefs about girls’ roles, combined with weak teacher preparation, keep education unequal. It also explains how new policies, such as the Gender Inclusion Fund and teacher training platforms like NISHTHA and DIKSHA, aim to solve these problems. The article argues that improving education in India needs both better teaching and stronger support for girls, along with real efforts to change attitudes in society. Only then can schools become truly inclusive and fair for every child.",

    intro: [
      "Education in India stands at a critical intersection of demographic opportunity and systemic challenge. With over 248 million school-going children and the world’s largest youth population, the country has immense potential to leverage education as a tool for equitable development. However, two persistent and interlinked barriers continue to undermine this goal: gender disparity in educational access and the uneven quality and accountability of teachers in the public system.  ",
      "Researchers such as Bandopadhyay (2008) and White et al. (2016) have emphasized how patriarchal norms, poverty, poor infrastructure, and safety concerns significantly hinder girls’ access to education, particularly among marginalized communities. Despite national efforts—such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the Right to Education Act, and the Gender Inclusion Fund under NEP 2020—gaps in enrolment, retention, and learning outcomes between boys and girls remain deeply entrenched.  Parallelly, the literature on teacher quality and professional accountability, such as studies by Hill (2011) and Mukherjee (2024), reveals critical deficiencies in both training institutions and systemic oversight. These gaps are magnified in rural and low-income areas. The Justice Verma Commission (2012) and recent Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) studies (2023–24) have exposed the commercialization of teacher education and stark subject mismatches that further exacerbate inequities in learning outcomes.  This review explores how gender disparities in education are not just shaped by socio-cultural barriers, but also reinforced—or potentially mitigated—by the quality and accountability of teachers. By examining intersecting policy frameworks, institutional structures, and socio-cultural dynamics, this article seeks to highlight the dual need for gender-responsive reforms and systemic improvements in teacher education to achieve inclusive, quality education for all.

          "Gender disparity in India encompasses systemic inequalities in health, education, employment, and politics, disproportionately affecting women. Rooted in patriarchal traditions, this disparity begins even before birth. Although India’s Constitution guarantees equal rights, deep-seated biases continue to restrict opportunities for women, especially in education. As per UNICEF and census data, between 2006 and 2010, only 26% of girls completed high school versus 50% of boys, and nearly 68% of girls remain undereducated. The 2011 Census shows an alarming gap: 82% literacy among boys compared to just 65% among girls. These inequalities are most visible among economically disadvantaged and rural populations.",

The 2002 Constitutional Amendment made education a fundamental right for children aged 6–14, launching the Education for All (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) campaign. Despite these strides, there is a significant gap between legal commitments and on-ground realities. UNICEF reports that 23% of girls drop out of school at puberty due to the lack of sanitation and privacy facilities, with many missing up to 50 school days per year due to menstruation",

          "According to White, Ruther, and Kahn (2016), gender inequality in educational outcomes is not only about access but about how social background, time use, and cultural attitudes intersect. Girls, especially in rural areas, are often burdened with sibling care or household chores, reducing their study time and leading to dropout. Traditional attitudes toward girl’s education, particularly among low-income and rural households, also contribute.

Poor school infrastructure—such as lack of toilets, libraries, and transportation—also deters girls from attending, particularly after puberty.

          "India, one of the fastest-growing nations, has 580 million people aged 5–24 years and over 248 million school-going students—the highest globally—alongside 4.7 crore students in higher education. This demographic profile makes quality education a foundational pillar for equitable economic growth and improved living standards. India has shown a long-standing commitment to SDG 4, which emphasizes inclusive and equitable quality education for all. At the core of achieving this within public schools lies the enhancement of teacher quality and accountability, which plays a significant role in improving the effectiveness of teaching (Hill, 2011). This has also been highlighted under Target 4.c, which calls for significantly increasing the number of qualified, trained, and competent teachers. Aligned with this, India has introduced key reforms such as the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, large-scale training programs like NISHTHA, and digital platforms like DIKSHA to equip every classroom with capable and accountable educators. However, despite these initiatives, persistent learning gaps in government schools are closely linked to variations in teacher competence, motivation, and weak systemic oversight (Yates, 2024). The Justice J.S. Verma Commission (2012) revealed that over 10,000 stand-alone TEIs were essentially commercializing degrees rather than providing quality teacher education. Furthermore, a 2024 TISS study across eight states found that 35–41% of mathematics teachers lacked a relevant degree, indicating critical subject mismatches.

The responsibilities of a teacher extend far beyond the confines of a classroom, encompassing the holistic development of students to equip them with the skills and resilience needed to navigate future life challenges. According to the World Bank (2018) and UNESCO (2021), teacher effectiveness has a greater impact on student performance than infrastructural inputs or class size. Thus, as teachers are the cornerstone of effective learning and student success, it becomes imperative that the quality of teaching evolves in tandem with advancements in the education system.",
          "Apart from quality, the accountability of teachers also holds great weight when it comes to the goal of quality education and bridging persistent learning gaps. Accountability ensures that teachers are not only present but also actively engaged, pedagogically effective, and aligned with curriculum goals (UNESCO, 2020). In public education systems, particularly in developing countries like India, the absence of strong accountability mechanisms has been linked to low teacher motivation, high absenteeism, and ineffective classroom practices (Muralidharan et al., 2017). When teachers are held responsible through supportive and outcome-driven mechanisms, it creates a ripple effect—raising classroom standards, enhancing student achievement, and building public trust in the education system.

    abstract: [
      "The Indo-U.S. bilateral relationship has undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving from the contested relations during the Cold War, into a strategic partnership shaped by mutual interests. Both nations have deepened their cooperation in defence, technology, innovation and other key sectors. Despite its potential, Indo-U.S. bilateral relations have become unpredictable ever since President Trump took office as the 47th President of the United States earlier this year. While expressing mutual interest and maintaining a good rapport with Prime Minister Modi, rising tariffs and trade barriers, mass deportations and increasing racial discrimination towards the Indian diaspora in the U.S. have strained the stability of this partnership.",
      "This article aims to trace the Indo-U.S. bilateral developments in seven parts, starting through the backdrop of President Biden’s administration followed by the tariff and trade practices and their implications. Then we critically examine defence relations, particularly the CAATSA sanctions, the plight of Indian students in the U.S. through the Harvard issue, the potential of transnational diplomacy, and the H-1B visa restrictions and the legacy of the Indian diaspora on the U.S. economy. The article concludes by evaluating the geopolitical implications of Indo-U.S. relations and its impact on international issues.",

    intro: [
      "The Indo-U.S. bilateral ties have been one of the most dynamic geopolitical relationships in the past century. Rooted in a history of dependency during the inception of an Independent India and a relationship of mistrust during the Non-Aligned Movement, both India and the U.S. have redefined their bilateral relations by increasing cooperation in various sectors. As two of the major players in the Indian ocean over maritime security, the cooperation between them is important to the geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific region. Emerging from the idea of the American Dream amongst aspiring Indians leading to an increase in population, the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and their cultural influence has played a significant role in the bilateral ties.",
      "Despite this deepening partnership, recent developments in their bilateral relationship is posing a major threat of uncertainty, particularly under President Trump’s administration during his second tenure. Areas such as tariffs, immigration and racial equity have been of great concern over the past few months. While high level diplomatic engagement between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the domestic political shift in the United States seems to hinder the broader trajectory of this bilateral cooperation.",
      "This article aims to analyse the current scenario and the evolving nature of the Indo-U.S. relations by examining key areas of concern which can be detrimental to both the U.S. and India in the long run. This can be observed through seven sections commencing with a backdrop of Indo-U.S. relations under President Biden’s administration, followed by a critical analysis of the emerging trade barriers, defense cooperation and the CAATSA sanctions, the increase in rampant racism against the Indian diaspora in the U.S., its effects on the academic and diplomatic outreach, the H1-B visa dynamics, and the role of the Indian diaspora in the larger picture of the United States’ exponential growth in science and technology. Through this analysis, the article evaluates the strategic and geopolitical implications of this evolving partnership in the constantly evolving international order.",

        paragraphs: [
          "The Biden administration geared its office at a time of global uncertainty. Against this backdrop, India rose as a pivotal partner in the United States’ efforts to strengthen international alliances and restore democratic notions. Biden’s approach was a clear reposition from the optics-driven, transactional engagement under President Trump toward a more congruous, institution-making bilateral relationship. Having served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as Vice President under Barack Obama, Biden introduced historical perspective and diplomatic continuity to Indo-US relations.",
          "Within his first 100 days in office, President Biden worked with Indian leadership through high-level calls, multilateral forums, and dialogues, emphasising India’s centrality in America's global vision. He emphasised shared democratic values, respect for human rights, and the importance of collaborative global governance as the foundation of the partnership.",
          "Biden’s initial achievements had resuscitated consultative platforms that had stagnated during the Trump era. The India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, reactivated in 2021, highlighted an extensive gamut of issues—defence cooperation, counterterrorism, energy security, and technology transfer. Similarly, the India-US Trade Policy Forum, CEO Forum, and Commercial Dialogue were re-launched, enabling structured conversations on market access, investment frameworks, and trade disputes.",
          "Both India and the US strengthened ties through defence logistics and coordination. India remains a “Major Defence Partner” of the US—on par with NATO allies— opening the gates to advanced military technologies. The two countries have signed all four foundational defence agreements, including BECA and COMCASA, enhancing interoperability and intelligence-sharing.",
          "The most transformative development under Biden has been the expansion of the tech partnership. In January 2023, the two nations instigated the India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), a milestone that profoundly institutionalised cooperation in semiconductors, quantum computing, AI, space technology, and 5G/6G telecom systems",
          "This also marked a move away from a purely defence-based technology exchange to collaborative innovation. Under the iCET, Indian and US firms have initiated joint projects such as the co-development of GE F-414 fighter jet engines for India’s LCA Mk2 aircraft—featuring up to 80% technology transfer, a significant leap from earlier defence deals. Furthermore, partnerships in clean energy tech under the US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 and the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) include collaboration on hydrogen fuel, battery storage, and smart grids.",
          "Indian-Americans now form one of the most influential diasporas in the US, with over 4.5 million people contributing to various sectors, including Silicon Valley, medicine, and academia. President Biden’s appointments of key Indian-origin officials—such as Neera Tanden, Vivek Murthy, and Uzra Zeya—had enhanced the dimension for diplomacy and strengthened cultural exchange bonds between the two nations ",
          "Academic and scientific cooperation remains vibrant, with over 200,000 Indian students enrolled in US universities (2023 data), contributing nearly $8 billion to the US economy annually. Collaboration in STEM education, skilled workforce mobility, and technological advancements remain a cornerstone of the relationship ",
          "Under Biden, the India-US relationship has upgraded beyond mere symbolic gestures to a significant advancement. The scope of bilateral ties and agendas has expanded from defence and security to include climate change, public health, advanced technology, and sustainable development. Although trade friction persists in areas like market access and digital taxation, the institutional resilience built under Biden ensures such issues are managed without derailing strategic cooperation.",
          "Ultimately, the Biden administration has not only reinforced traditional strategic ties but also charted new avenues for collaboration, positioning the India-US partnership as one of the most comprehensive and future-ready bilateral relationships in the 21st century.",

        paragraphs: [
          "India–U.S. relations have come a long way historically, from an ideological distance to a pragmatic—not always harmonious—cooperation. India’s non-alignment during the Cold War symbolized that India was not easily courted by the United States. India’s liberalization in the 1990s and, most importantly, the 2005 civil nuclear agreement, ushered in a new period of engagement and trust (Wikipedia, 2025). In 2022–2023, bilateral trade in goods and services crossed $190 billion, maintaining its remarkable growth trajectory (Rao, 2024). India found itself to be a key market and strategic partner in Asia, and the United States became India’s largest trading partner. However, tensions simmered under the surface, particularly over trade imbalances and tariff structures. The United States operates a large deficit in its trade with India, an issue that President Trump has complained about incessantly since his electoral victory last fall. India received preferential market access under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which provided for duty-free exports of roughly $5.6 billion per year (USTR, 2019). In 2019, Trump rescinded India’s GSP advantages, claiming that it had not supplied “fair and cheap” (USTR, 2019).",
          "Yet in Trump’s second term, this friction quickly transformed into a major trade conflict. The administration announced a retaliatory tariff on selected Indian goods of 26% in April 2025 that was suspended temporarily (90 days) to give time for negotiations to find common ground (Kumar, 2025). Following immediately, President Trump ended US preferential treatment of imports from India, and criticized India’s average applied tariff of 17.6%, one of the highest for any major economy, and calling India the “tariff king”. Sectors such as agriculture, automobile and medical devices were especially focused on. This seems to be Trump’s goal of “reciprocity”—to force India to lower its tariff wall while it raises imports of U.S. energy, defense, and high-tech products. India has countered, noting that its tariff rates are far below WTO-bound rates, and that its retaliatory duties on almonds, walnuts, and apples are valid responses to the U.S.’s security-based retaliatory tariffs on steel and aluminum from 2018 (TOI, 2025).",
          "This reflects what many describe as Trump’s broader tactic—used not just with India, but globally. It's a “maximum pressure, minimum compromise” strategy: issue extreme tariff threats, provoke panic, then delay or soften them slightly and call it a win. This creates the illusion of negotiation while crediting himself with resolution. India appears a pawn in this larger model of transactional diplomacy, where perception trumps fair policy (Graham, 2025). Trump used similar approaches with the EU and China—threatening 25% auto tariffs and securing symbolic concessions (Reuters, 2025), or raising tariffs to pressure China into the “Phase One” deal (Gattiker et al., 2025).",
          "India needs to exercise caution. Avoiding tariffs may feel like success, but genuine negotiation requires mutual respect. India’s counter strategy must reflect strategic autonomy—not appeasement. Only then can it define its trade future from a position of strength.",

        paragraphs: [
          "With Donald Trump reintroduced once more on January 20, 2025, for his second non-consecutive term as the 47th U.S. president, the issue of CAATSA sanctions on India’s S-400 buy has taken on renewed criticality. The current U.S. organisation, firmly rooted in the “America First” ideology, faces a fundamental test: implement the spirit of sanctions, or shift toward a pragmatic organisation?",
          "Amid Trump’s to begin with term, his administration transparently cautioned India about CAATSA punishments, whereas opening the door partially open for a waiver in the event that New Delhi moved toward U.S. military gear. Presently, four of the five S-400 regiments are currently deployed along India’s borders with China and Pakistan, with the ultimate framework anticipated by early 2026 .This buy, imperative to India’s defence calculus, has drawn renewed attention in Washington and reignited the talk about over vital consistency versus lawful commitment.",
          "Trump’s moment term has as of now seen clear official actions—some indeed focusing on worldwide institutions—and a forceful position on remote approach, including suspension of military aid to Ukraine and reinvigorated duties on China and North America.  Whereas this signals a harder pose toward equal powers, it too raises concerns that CAATSA may be used more entirely against India, especially to strengthen U.S. dominance in worldwide defence exchange.",
          "Authorising India through and through, be that as it may, may demonstrate politically impulsive. As a key partner within the Indo-Pacific and an individual popular government, penalising Unused Delhi may unwind collaborative endeavours beneath the Quad system and weaken certainty in the U.S. administration. It would be seen as rebuffing a vital accomplice at a time when Chinese self-assuredness within the South China Ocean and Taiwan Strait is powers, and when the U.S. itself is looking for dependable accomplices to maintain a rules-based arrange within the Indo-Pacific.",
          "A more discretionary course would be a carefully organised CAATSA waiver for India. But it shouldn't be a clear check. The White House seem to require steps like expanded acquisition of U.S. defence frameworks, more significant joint development projects—for example, missile-tracking radars or ramble systems—and more profound participation in shared security alliances. This mirrors Trump’s first-term dialect: India “will discover out” on the off chance that it remains too close to Russian weapons, but that a waiver is conceivable under the correct conditions.  For India, exploring this requires subtlety. Delhi might depict the S-400 as a transitional defence fence, signalling preparation to slowly turn toward American stages.",
          "That might incorporate committing to construct more U.S.-supplied frameworks domestically—extending the India-U.S. defence-industrial base—and emphasising interoperability in military drills and insights sharing. ",
          "At its centre, the S-400 issue may be a stretch test, for CAATSA's unbending nature and for India's vital belief. Beneath President Trump’s momentous term, the stakes have risen. But in case both nations select exchange over authoritative opinion, the result might reaffirm their shared interest in building a strong, multipolar, and equitable Indo-Pacific.",
          "For India, this implies keeping up its teaching of vital independence, while signalling a future direction more adjusted with American tech and tenet. For Trump’s organisation, it is an opportunity to illustrate vital adaptability without undermining authoritative expectations.",

        paragraphs: [
          "In 2025, A political and legal conflict emerged between Harvard University and Trump administration, now commonly being referred to as the “Harvard Issue.” This issue has attracted global attention regarding academic freedom, International Student Rights, and foreign relations. The issue unfolded as the Federal Government of the US accused Harvard of failing to comply with federal guidelines, started citing concerns over ideological extremism, race – based practices and non-cooperation in the student monitoring. The actions to these accusations lead to a policy decision, which includes Threats to revoke Visa, termination of research grants and a suspension of Harvard’s ability to host foreign students. These proposed changes led to reactions of shock across the International academic community, including India.  ",
          "India, being one of the largest contributors to the student base in the majority of the US Institutions has felt a significant impact. Hundreds and Thousands of Indian students apply to American Institutions annually, with Harvard being one of the topmost of choices for advanced study and research. On April 16, 2025, the Trump Administration issued a directive more of a threat to revoke Harvard’s membership for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, SEVP which directly jeopardized the enrolment of International Students, including Indians. This temporary barring led to widespread anxiety and disrupted academic plans for students across the globe.",
          "Further escalating the issue, on June 4, President Trump signed a proclamation suspending Visas F, M and J categories for new enrolments/ students at Harvard, which cities concerns for foreign ties, although a federal judge later issued an injunction against Trump’s Proclamation on June 20. This to-and-fro between the Federal government and Harvard highlights the vulnerability of international students to shifting political climates.",
          "Indian students were affected in many ways. First, there was increased uncertainty around visa insurance and renewals which led to many prospective students to either delay applications or consider alternative destinations for study and research such as Canada or Europe. Second, The Political opinions of the federal government labelling some foreign students radical or anti–American created an alarming effect where students felt compelled to self–censor academic or political opinion. Third, Indian scholars engaged in research associations with Harvard faces disruptions due to the suspension of federal grants and funding, thereby limiting academic exchange.",
          "With funding for Joint research programs suddenly stopped and access for Indian students blocked, the Indian universities faced both academic and administrative lags, the situation highlighted that how quickly politics could disrupt academic ties. The threat to Harvard tax exempt status and the sweeping visa restrictions served as a wake–up call. In response many Indian academic institutions started reassessing the risk of heavy dependence on US-based academic networks.",
          "At its core, the Harvard issue reflects a growing intersection between education, politics and international relations. For Indian students and institutions, this issue serves as an eye opener that academic opportunities are not immune to geopolitical shifts and also emphasizes the importance of diversifying global partnership and advocating for the protection of academic mobility and freedom. While the legal outcomes of the conflict are still evolving, the implications for India-US academic relations are clear. Transparency, mutual respect and policy stability are essential to sustaining educational exchange in an increasingly polarized world.",

          "5.	To What Extent Did Culture, Media, and Diaspora Outweigh Transactional Diplomacy in India-US Relations Under Trump’s Second-Term Policies?",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Indo- American relationship is built upon diverse threads, woven together by their shared strategic interests, economic ties, democratic values, and vibrant people-to-people connections, strengthened over decades by migration and flow of cultural exchange, and mutual aspirations across the Pacific. The soft-power elements of culture, media, and especially the Indo-American diaspora foster a transnational synergy that blends Indian traditions with American innovation, shaping both countries’ cultural identities, political values, and foreign policies.",
          "With President Trump’s return to the White House, the tone of this relationship shifted. The administration’s focus on transactional diplomacy, defined by a relentless focus on immediate and reciprocal gains over long-term strategic partnership, sidelined the soft-power diplomacy (Rossow, 2024). First, the Trump administration targeted USAID which had a $35 billion budget, mostly for health, education, and governance, especially in Africa. While the agency still exists on paper, it has been effectively dismantled. Cutting USAID has reduced U.S. presence in poor countries resulting in weakening of its soft- power influence and global messaging (Weinstein, 2025). Along with this, the 1,116th page ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ imposes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent by US’s non-citizens, impacting Indians who are a significant portion of the US immigrant population. CA Manoj K Pahwa, FEMA & International Tax Consultant, says “To avoid paying 3.5% tax, many of them would now increasingly invest money in the US itself.” Thus, the tax would discourage remittances to India and prompt increased US investments (ADAJANIA, 2025).",
          "Trump’s second-term agenda had also rapidly expanded deportation operations, directly impacting Indian communities, with over 20,000 undocumented Indians facing removal orders or detention. The crackdown has heightened fear and instability among mixed-status Indian families and the broader diaspora. This shift has diminished the role of the U.S. soft power by projecting an image of exclusion rather than openness, making it harder for the Indian diaspora to contribute to American innovation and culture. Policies prioritizing increased tariffs, trade balances, and immigration quotas often clash with the living realities of the diaspora and the aspirations of young Indians and Americans alike.",
          "Despite the dominance of transactional diplomacy, soft power elements have shown resilience. The Indian diaspora in the United States, now numbering over 4.5 million, continues to play a critical role in shaping bilateral ties through enhanced political integration and advocacy. Indian-Americans secured influential positions within the Trump administration, including Harmeet Kaur Dhillon as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Vivek Ramaswamy in government efficiency, and Kash Patel’s nomination as FBI Director. These appointments amplified the diaspora’s voice, which enabled protection of the interests of Indian professionals and students. With U.S. funded programs scaled back, India leaned into its own soft power, supporting academic partnerships, diaspora-led festivals, and digital diplomacy. High-profile diaspora-driven cultural events such as “Howdy, Modi!” and “Namaste Trump” along with Indian cuisine, yoga, and Bollywood symbolized the community’s ability to act as a cultural bridge. Media, meanwhile, became both a battleground and a bridge. As trade disputes and policy disagreements made headlines, Indian diplomats, diaspora leaders, and think tanks worked to reframe the narrative. ",
          "Yet, for all their resilience, these soft power forces faced real limits. Transactional diplomacy often sets the boundaries of possibility. Tariffs were not undone by goodwill, and visa restrictions could not be lifted by community advocacy alone. Even the strongest diaspora voices confronted the harsh realities of “America First” policies. As Joseph Nye warned, Trump’s coercive, transactional view of power risked eroding U.S. soft power, much like China’s aggressive diplomacy backfired (Nye, 2004). So, to what extent did culture, media, and diaspora outweigh transactional diplomacy in this new era? While they did not always prevail, these soft power elements softened tensions, kept channels open, and ensured the relationship remained more than a series of deals. They may not have shaped every outcome, but they safeguarded the relationship’s soul. They did not outweigh transactional diplomacy but they endured beyond it, laying the groundwork for a more inclusive and enduring chapter in India- U.S. relations.",

          "The H-1B visa was created under the Immigration Act of 1990 in order to counter labour shortages in the United States. The Act intended to permit immigrants from all over the world for skilled labour, particularly in science and technology. In the fiscal year of 2023, around 72% out of the total recipients of the H-1B visa were Indians . The Indian diaspora has been one of the most academically accomplished and successful immigrant communities in the United States. But despite all of their contribution to the U.S. economy, Indian immigrants working under the H-1B visa are under the risk of being deported back to India.",
          "Indian immigrants were initially limited to the H1 visa, which was provided to qualified immigrant workers of about 65,000 per year, who intended to work temporarily in the U.S. These provisions were relaxed over time, eventually leading to the American Competitiveness and Work Force Improvement Act of 1998, which increased the number from 65,000 to 1,15,000. This increase was lobbied by tech companies who recruited more foreign workers due to lack of skilled labour among American workers.",
          "One of the major criticisms is against Indian tech companies who follow a system of offshore development centres in India with an on-site presence in the U.S., raising concerns as they directly generate revenue to the host country. This, clubbed with the mass lay-offs and unemployment during the pandemic served as a catalyst for anti-immigration sentiments under President Trump’s administration. Policies such as ‘Buy American, Hire American’  were intended to increase employment opportunities for American workers. However, research suggests that for every H-1B visa rejection, companies hired 0.4 employees abroad, undermining the intended goal of protecting American jobs.",
          "The Indian influence on American technology and innovation is particularly profound. For instance, 16 of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023  were led by CEOs of Indian origin. A 2015 study observed data from 219 cities conducted between 1990 to 2010 and concluded that H-1B visa holders had increased innovation and job opportunities in the U.S., particularly in STEM branches and the tech sector, as well as increasing wages among non-skilled native workers (Peri, 2015). Another study shows increased patent registrations in the U.S. from 1975 to 2004, among Chinese and Indian immigrants in STEM research and development (Kerr, 2010). This shows that Indian immigrants are not just participating in American innovation, but are also driving it.",
          "Most bilateral cooperations such as the Transforming Relations Utilising Strategic Technologies (TRUST)  depends on talent mobility, and limiting Indian access to work visas can weaken such initiatives. These restrictions can also shrink access to critical STEM research, potentially stalling global innovation. With China’s rapid excellence in science and technology, a stronger India-U.S. tech collaboration has never been more critical. Therefore, the relaxation of H-1B visa restrictions is paramount in order to sustain true innovation.",

As China remains the world’s leading semiconductor producer with an advanced fabrication facility, India needs to leverage its own resources particularly after the recent discovery of over 5.9 million tons of lithium in Jammu and Kashmir. If harnessed successfully will strengthen India's ambition of becoming Atma Nirbhar and at the same time make it an important player in the global supply chain. ",

          "As Russia remains India's top crude oil supplier and the trade between the two is predicted to reach US 100 billion dollar in this decade. Trump may find a way for this relationship to benefit both India and the US considering India's strategic importance and the US’s long-term vision for the Indo-Pacific. The US relies on imports of refined petroleum from India and this oil is sourced by India from Russia (Mishra et al., 2025). India came under pressure under Biden from the US to buy its Russians cheap crude oil, but it always tried to balance its relations with Russia and the West not openly, displeasing Russia, but cooperating with the US and its allies in the defence, climate, and trade. This non-aligned, multi-vector diplomacy provided India the space to manoeuvre. ",
          "Improving ties with Russia would support Trump's agenda to end the Russia Ukraine conflict while creating an opportunity to weaken the Russia-China-axis (Mishra et al., 2025). A warming-up of relations with Russia also would help Trump's goals to end the Russia-Ukraine war and would open up prospects for a wedge to be driven between the Russia-China alliance. India has always respected Ukraine’s territorial integrity and that’s why Trump’s policy is to pull the support out for Ukraine to end the war. In this context, it could very likely be in the interests of both the US and India to have a strategic partnership that differs from America's approach towards Russia in the past.",

For a country with a long tradition of being against colonialism, India’s neutrality on what is generally perceived as a case of genocide may weaken its moral authority and leadership in the Global South. Historically, India has pursued strategic autonomy, and the current middle ground India is walking, where India did not stand with Israel by condemning neither Hamas nor Gaza—threatens to undermine this legacy.",
          "Trump has also supported the idea of attacking Iranian oil fields. Although this could be perceived as a decision aimed at escalating Israel's war on Iran, it is merely an aspect of Trump's real politic inspired isolationist policy towards the middle East aimed at terminating the Iran issue (Mishra et al., 2025) Strategic infrastructure like the Chabahar Port and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) are key to India’s connectivity to Central Asia and Europe and serves as a perfect counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Since the attacks on October 7 and mounting tensions between Iran and Israel seem to have cast a long shadow on the development, potentially pulling the plug on India’s connectivity aspirations. In light of all this, India must keep its engagement with the U.S. transactional, based on shared interests, not values, without surrendering its core values or sacrificing its leadership in the Global South.

          "7.4. The Progress India Is Making On Climate Without Global U.S. Talks",
          "There is a growing divide between the Global North and Global South on climate issues. The North developed its economies at high carbon emissions levels and now the South, and particularly countries like India, are feeling the worst effects of climate change. A recent report from the World Meteorological Organization lay bare the loss and damage already being caused by the climate crisis and its disproportionate impact on those least responsible in developing countries. In view of these challenges Global frameworks such as the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals address the imbalance and push for climate change technology transfer and climate finance from North to South to allow developing countries to achieve goals such as net zero by 2070. ",
          "Under Trump the US disengaged with the Paris Agreement followed by the UK, Germany, Netherlands, France and Canada. Furthermore, US absence in the 2025 Bonn Climate Conference (SB62) raised concerns. Besides, finance was not even on the agenda as a topic of discussion. As per Press Information Bureau India, Coal is vital to India’s energy needs, supplying over half of the country’s power. Despite renewable energy growth, coal-based thermal power will remain essential, with its share projected at 55% by 2030 and 27% by 2047. India is moving from 70 percent coal dependence to renewable energy like solar and hydro so support from global partners is essential. Therefore, it is imperative for India to push the US to return to climate talks and fulfil promises on finance and technology. ",

    conclusion: [
      "In the current context, the Indo-U.S. relationship finds itself at an inflection point - reflecting not only on the progress of this relationship but through a turbulent political climate. While collaboration in areas of trade, defence, technology, and education brought these military partners closer, new developments have uncovered a glaring vulnerability. Indian immigrants are facing a crisis in holding dual status within the state, as anti-immigration sentiments and massive layoffs might evolve into long-term policies. ",
      "Yet, no evidence suggests the relationship is on the verge of rupture. Members of the Indian diaspora, along with numerous shared interests, continue to promote the interdependence of these two nations. Given the meteoric rise of China with respect to economic, technological, and regional power, these two nations must have stronger coordination. The Trump administration requires consistency in policies and sensitivity to culture if it hopes to altercations bilateral relations healthily. ",
      "If these bilateral and institutional partnerships keep on increasing ties between our peoples, these two countries can create mediums, provide greater innovation and research technology/science. That said, it would be important for mutual understanding of how to navigate and manage emerging temporal conflicts of interest. As similar nations, Indo-U.S. relations will endure and shape global order through policy sanctions and diplomacy. ",

      "Diplomacy Beyond Diplomats: ADR and Its Promise in High-Stakes International Conflicts",
    author:

    authorAbbrev: "S. Mishra, R. Sayed and others",
    abstract: [
      "This research paper examines the evolving role of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in navigating contemporary international conflicts that have proven resistant to traditional diplomacy and military deterrence. It brings together a diverse array of case studies—India–China–Pakistan’s territorial and hydropolitical disputes, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo’s complex legacy of genocide and regional insurgency, and the Russia–Ukraine war—situating each within the broader framework of international law, multilateral mediation, and state sovereignty.",
      "Through doctrinal analysis and comparative case study, the paper assesses how ADR instruments such as arbitration, mediation, conciliation, and community-based justice systems have been employed or evaded in these conflict zones. In South Asia, treaty-based mechanisms under the Indus Waters Treaty have functioned as rare instances of successful legal ADR, whereas bilateral stalemates in Kashmir and Sino–Indian borders reveal the structural and political resistance to third-party intervention. In Central Africa, the study explores both the grassroots justice of Rwanda’s Gacaca courts and the failure of inclusive mediation in the DRC despite multilateral efforts like the Luanda and Nairobi Processes. The Russia–Ukraine war serves as a cautionary exemplar of the collapse of international ADR frameworks when great power politics and unilateralism overtake dialogue and law.",
      "The analysis foregrounds the strengths of ADR in creating legal, depoliticized channels for negotiation, especially in high-tension environments, but also acknowledges the fragility of such frameworks in the face of asymmetrical power, nationalist rhetoric, and lack of enforcement. It critiques the underutilization of institutional ADR—such as the International Court of Justice, Permanent Court of Arbitration, and African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights—and examines the promise of Track II diplomacy and hybrid regional processes.",
      "Ultimately, the paper argues that ADR, when institutionally embedded and politically supported, holds transformative potential for long-term peacebuilding. Its success hinges not only on legal design, but also on the willingness of regional powers to prioritize cooperative sovereignty, the strengthening of multilateral institutions, and the integration of local actors in the resolution architecture. By treating ADR not as a diplomatic afterthought but as a core peacebuilding mechanism, the international community can reclaim space for law and justice amid an increasingly fractured global order.",
    ],
    intro: [
      "In an era marked by resurgent authoritarianism, hardened borders, and shifting power alignments, the question of how to resolve conflict without violence is more urgent than ever. Conventional diplomacy and military deterrence have repeatedly failed to prevent protracted conflict across the globe, exposing the limitations of state-centric, security-first approaches to peace. In this context, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), encompassing methods such as arbitration, mediation, conciliation, and community-based mechanisms, offers a compelling legal and institutional alternative. Its appeal lies not only in its adaptability and cultural flexibility, but also in its potential to de-escalate high-stakes conflicts where formal adjudication is politically unviable or diplomatically taboo.",
      "This paper explores the viability of ADR as a peacebuilding mechanism across three conflict zones that, despite differing geographies and histories, share a common thread of legal uncertainty, strategic rivalry, and contested sovereignty: South Asia, the African Great Lakes region, and Eastern Europe. In each, the limits of traditional diplomacy have left space for alternative frameworks that either have been tested in practice or remain critically underutilized. The objective is not only to assess where and how ADR has been applied, but also to interrogate the legal, political, and cultural conditions under which it can meaningfully succeed.",
      "From the community-based Gacaca courts of post-genocide Rwanda to the stalled neutral expert processes in the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, ADR mechanisms have taken radically different institutional shapes—rooted variously in local tradition, international law, and treaty frameworks. In some cases, like Rwanda’s hybrid reconciliation courts or India–Pakistan’s use of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, ADR has facilitated dialogue and conflict management even amid political hostility. In others, such as the India–China border disputes or the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war, states have systematically avoided legal ADR mechanisms altogether—favoring unilateralism, great-power politics, or non-binding diplomacy over third-party adjudication.",
      "What emerges across these regions is a pattern of underused legal potential: where ADR is deployed, it often works within narrow technical confines; where it is avoided, it is not because of lack of relevance but because of political resistance to ceding authority to neutral forums. Sovereignty sensitivities, institutional mistrust, and fears of precedent-setting all contribute to the fragility of international ADR. And yet, the very intractability of these conflicts points to the need for neutral, rules-based dispute resolution outside the constraints of power politics.",
      "This research thus examines how ADR has operated within these complex regional ecosystems—both formally and informally—and what legal, diplomatic, and institutional innovations might be necessary to render it a more central pillar of global peacebuilding. By drawing on treaty analysis, institutional case studies, and comparative legal scholarship, the paper aims to reimagine ADR not as a secondary alternative to statecraft, but as a legitimate, adaptable, and urgently needed mode of international conflict resolution.",

        heading: "Literature Review",
        paragraphs: [
          "The literature on ADR spans a wide spectrum of methodologies, from traditional mechanisms like mediation and negotiation to culturally embedded hybrid forums such as Rwanda’s Gacaca courts. Scholars have debated the viability, legitimacy, and scalability of such mechanisms, especially when transplanted into complex international conflicts.",
          "In the African Great Lakes region, Rwanda presents one of the most cited post-genocide ADR models through its Gacaca courts. Scholars like Clark (2010) have commended the system for balancing restorative and retributive justice, re-establishing social cohesion after the 1994 genocide. The courts allowed for community participation in adjudicating genocide crimes, fostering reconciliation at the grassroots. However, critical perspectives, notably by, have raised concerns over due process violations, coercive confessions, and uneven power dynamics within informal systems. The literature thus highlights the double-edged nature of localized ADR—effective in societal healing, yet vulnerable to human rights critiques.",
          "In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) represents the difficulties of embedding ADR in an ongoing conflict environment. Autesserre (2010) emphasizes how fragmented armed groups, weak institutional frameworks, and lack of consistent political will have rendered many ADR attempts ineffective. A paper in International Alert further argues that while community-led reconciliation forums have made local gains, they often lack linkage to national legal structures and international support, limiting their ability to scale into national peace processes. This raises important questions about the sustainability of informal mechanisms without broader systemic reform.",
          "South Asia provides a distinct lens through which to analyze ADR at the interstate level. The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) between India and Pakistan, brokered by the World Bank in 1960, is often cited as a rare example of successful treaty-based ADR. Scholars such as Salman (2002) have examined the treaty’s embedded multi-tiered dispute resolution framework, including neutral expert review and Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) proceedings, as instrumental in de-escalating water disputes despite recurring hostilities. Yet, as India continues to reject third-party mediation in politically sensitive areas like Kashmir, ADR remains constrained by political will and strategic sovereignty concerns. The India–China conflict similarly avoids formal ADR processes, with both states opting instead for confidence-building measures and bilateral diplomatic dialogues, which lack legal enforceability. ",
          "In the Russia–Ukraine conflict, ADR mechanisms have largely been sidelined, with formal diplomacy failing to prevent full-scale war. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the 2022 invasion reflect a broader breakdown in international legal norms and institutions. While some scholarship highlights the role of the Minsk Agreements as a failed ADR initiative, others point to the erosion of trust in international bodies like the UN or OSCE as a critical barrier. The literature increasingly views the conflict as a case of 'lawfare'—the strategic use and manipulation of international law as a tool of war rather than peace.",
          "Finally, scholars such as Jones (2015) have emphasized the growing relevance of Track II diplomacy—informal legal dialogue among non-state actors, including academics, civil society, and former diplomats. These softer forms of ADR are seen as essential precursors to formal negotiation, particularly in deeply polarized environments. However, institutionalizing such frameworks and ensuring their uptake at the state level remain major challenges.",
          "Taken together, the literature reveals that while ADR holds substantial promise in theory, its practical application is often impeded by power asymmetries, weak enforcement structures, and cultural divergences in conflict resolution norms. The challenge lies not merely in designing ADR mechanisms, but in fostering the political, legal, and social ecosystems in which such mechanisms can thrive.",

        paragraphs: [
          "The India–Pakistan–China triangle remains one of the world’s most persistent and dangerous zones of geopolitical volatility. All three are nuclear powers with longstanding territorial and strategic disputes, minimal mutual trust, and low institutional cooperation. Despite intermittent dialogue and confidence-building measures, the region has failed to establish sustainable peace. Traditional diplomacy, limited to formal talks and military deterrence, has often escalated tensions or yielded fragile outcomes. In this context, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) offers a legally structured and depoliticized pathway to conflict resolution.",
          "ADR methods, including arbitration, mediation, and neutral expert review, function outside the constraints of formal litigation, allowing for greater flexibility, confidentiality, and preservation of state sovereignty (Lando, 2021). Particularly in high-stakes international conflicts, ADR provides structured legal mechanisms that can de-escalate tensions and avoid protracted diplomatic deadlocks. In South Asia, where political grievances intersect with issues of water sharing, territorial demarcation, and infrastructure spillover, ADR mechanisms offer underutilized, yet promising, legal routes toward stability.",

          "India and China share a 3,488 km long undemarcated border, with territorial disputes concentrated in Aksai Chin (claimed by India but controlled by China) and Arunachal Pradesh (claimed by China). Despite bilateral agreements like the 1993 Agreement on Peace and Tranquility and the 1996 CBMs, there has been no lasting resolution. The Doklam standoff (2017) and the Galwan Valley clash (2020) revealed the ineffectiveness of existing mechanisms and the lack of trust in bilateral diplomatic channels (MEA India, 2020; Panda, 2021).",
          "China’s longstanding rejection of third-party adjudication poses a structural barrier to ADR. This posture was reaffirmed when Beijing refused to participate in the PCA’s 2016 South China Sea arbitration, reinforcing its preference for unilateral or bilateral approaches over legal internationalism (PCA, 2016).",
          "The India–Pakistan conflict centers on the status of Jammu and Kashmir, marked by insurgency and cross-border violence. The Simla Agreement (1972) stipulates bilateral resolution, but political shifts, particularly India’s revocation of Article 370 in 2019, have exacerbated tensions and challenged previous legal frameworks (Qureshi, 2020). While India resists external mediation in Kashmir, it has engaged in structured ADR through other treaty mechanisms.",
          "One notable success is the Indus Waters Treaty (1960), which regulates the use of shared rivers and embeds a formal ADR mechanism. Article IX of the treaty provides a tiered system: disputes are first addressed by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), then a Neutral Expert, and if unresolved, arbitration under the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). This model has endured wars and regime changes, offering a rare example of legal continuity.",

The PCA ruled partially in Pakistan’s favour, reinforcing that the legal dispute resolution process could function even in politically strained contexts. More recently, arbitration has resumed on the Ratle dam, with PCA hearings initiated in 2023, despite India’s objections regarding procedural irregularities.",
          "However, India remains cautious about extending third-party adjudication to politically sensitive disputes like Kashmir. Its refusal to engage international forums such as the ICJ or UN mediators reflects a rigid interpretation of bilateralism enshrined in the Simla Agreement and broader sovereignty sensitivities.",
          "Unlike with Pakistan, India’s disputes with China lack formal legal resolution mechanisms. Despite recurring skirmishes and standoffs, both countries have confined themselves to non-binding diplomatic platforms such as the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) and the Special Representatives' dialogue. These platforms, while useful for managing incidents, offer no legal enforceability or resolution mechanism.",
          "China’s resistance to adjudication extends beyond India. Its categorical rejection of the PCA’s jurisdiction in the Philippines v. China case over the South China Sea reflects a consistent opposition to legal arbitration. This refusal to accept neutral forums makes ADR nearly impossible unless mutually agreed upon in advance via treaty—a condition not currently met.",
          "The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) remains the most relevant ADR forum in South Asia, especially under treaty-based mechanisms like the IWT. Its ability to function despite political tensions demonstrates the strength of embedded legal structures. However, its role is limited where no treaty exists or where parties refuse to submit to its jurisdiction.",
          "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) offers another forum, but its jurisdiction is based on mutual consent. India has expressly excluded disputes involving Commonwealth countries and national security from ICJ jurisdiction, further limiting its utility.",
          "UNCLOS mechanisms, though available for maritime and environmental disputes, have not been invoked in the Himalayan context. Future riverine conflicts may test its applicability, particularly if transboundary environmental harm becomes legally actionable. Regional organizations like SAARC and SCO lack standing arbitration panels or dispute resolution mandates, and deep-seated inter-state distrust has stalled progress on this front.",

        paragraphs: [
          "To harness ADR as a tool for long-term regional peace, South Asia must move beyond reactive diplomacy and toward institutional innovation. First, there is a need for a trilateral ADR treaty between India, Pakistan, and China. Focused on non-military disputes—water sharing, infrastructure spillover, and environmental damage—this treaty could embed binding arbitration clauses, jurisdiction triggers, and neutral expert mechanisms modeled after the IWT but expanded in scope.",
          "Second, regional forums like SAARC or SCO should establish permanent arbitration panels, composed of legal, technical, and diplomatic experts nominated by member states. These panels should operate under transparent procedural rules, with opt-in jurisdiction for states willing to resolve disputes legally.",
          "Third, Track II legal diplomacy must be formalized. These informal expert dialogues, engaging retired judges, scholars, and ADR professionals, can serve as precursors to formal arbitration, particularly when political sensitivities make official engagement untenable. Such forums could promote cross-border legal education, collaborative research, and shared ADR training, helping build trust over time.",
          "Lastly, mechanisms such as hybrid ADR models, combining technical conciliation with optional legal escalation, could be applied to issues where political or legal standstills prevail. This phased approach balances sovereignty concerns with dispute resolution needs, especially in riverine or environmental disputes.",
          "In conclusion, ADR's promise in South Asia is demonstrated through functional examples like the IWT but is curtailed by sovereignty concerns, lack of institutional platforms, and political resistance to third-party resolution. Addressing these challenges through legal treaties, regional mechanisms, and informal diplomacy is not merely idealistic—it is essential for preventing the next escalation in one of the world's most fragile trilateral relationships.",

The most recent escalation, marked by the March 23 Movement (M23)’s seizure of Goma in early 2025, cannot be viewed in isolation. It is the latest episode in a long history of violence that began in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, which saw nearly one million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered by Hutu extremists.

          "As the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), led by Paul Kagame, took control in Rwanda, over a million Hutu refugees, including perpetrators of the genocide, fled into eastern Zaire, now the DRC. Their presence destabilized the region, as Tutsi minorities in Congo, particularly the Banyamulenge, felt increasingly threatened by these exiled militias. Rwanda’s subsequent military interventions in the DRC were officially justified as efforts to neutralize these extremist elements.",
          "This refugee crisis and the resulting militarization catalyzed the First Congo War (1996–1997), during which a Rwandan-backed coalition ousted the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and installed Laurent Kabila as president. The alliance soon crumbled, leading to the Second Congo War (1998–2003), a conflict involving nine African countries and numerous armed groups. Estimates suggest that the death toll, both from direct violence and the humanitarian catastrophe it unleashed, reached upwards of six million. Although a transitional government was established in 2003 and elections were held in 2006, the eastern provinces remained plagued by instability, with various armed groups continuing to operate.",
          "Among these groups, M23 emerged as a prominent force in the early 2010s, primarily composed of Tutsi fighters claiming to defend their communities from persecution. Supported by Rwanda, according to multiple UN reports, M23’s insurgency reignited regional tensions. Though the group was temporarily defeated in 2013 through joint efforts by the Congolese army and an offensive UN peacekeeping brigade, its resurgence in the 2020s culminated in the 2025 offensive on Goma, during which hundreds to possibly thousands were killed and massive displacement ensued. Rwanda’s alleged role in supporting M23 continues to provoke diplomatic confrontation, with the DRC accusing Kigali of violating its sovereignty and facilitating violence through proxies.",
          "At the core of this conflict lies not only ethnic and political strife but also a fierce contest over resources. The eastern DRC holds some of the world’s largest reserves of cobalt, copper, and other minerals vital to the global electronics and clean energy sectors. Over the last decade, Chinese firms—often with direct ties to Beijing—have acquired significant stakes in Congolese mining operations, displacing prior Western investments. These commercial interests are intertwined with the militarization of the region; Congolese forces have frequently been deployed to protect Chinese-operated sites, and Chinese military equipment, including drones and arms, has been used by both the Congolese government and regional actors. Reports of corruption, labor exploitation, and even child labor have marred these operations, further complicating the international community’s engagement with the DRC.",

In parallel, the Luanda Process, facilitated by Angola and operating through the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), focuses on de-escalating tensions between the DRC and Rwanda. Despite diplomatic overtures and the involvement of multilateral institutions, both processes have been hampered by mutual mistrust, competing political agendas, and escalatory military developments. A humanitarian truce brokered by the United States and Angola in mid-2024 offered a brief respite but fell short of catalyzing a durable resolution.",
          "The conflict has also entered the legal arena. In 2023, the DRC brought a case before the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, accusing Rwanda of breaching international law through its support for M23 and deployment of troops on Congolese soil. Rwanda challenged the court’s jurisdiction, but as both countries are signatories to the African Charter, they are bound to respect the court’s eventual ruling.

In recent briefings, MONUSCO, the UN’s stabilization mission in the DRC, warned that the M23 crisis risks igniting a broader regional war, especially in light of the continued presence of over 250 armed groups in the region. The Congolese government maintains that any meaningful negotiation is impossible, so long as Rwandan troops and proxy militias operate within its territory, while Rwanda insists that the DRC’s governance failures have endangered its national security and Tutsi populations.",

Additionally, discussions are underway to revitalize the 2013 Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the Region, a landmark but under-implemented agreement.

While the actors, regions, and rhetoric differ, commonalities emerge: the weaponization of ethnicity and nationalism, the manipulation of international legal norms, and the recurrent failure of mediation mechanisms to yield durable peace. The persistence of such conflicts reveals not merely the limitations of bilateral diplomacy, but the structural inertia within multilateral systems—often marred by geopolitical interests, competing alliances, and selective enforcement of international law.",
          "In South Asia, the India-China-Pakistan triangle remains encumbered by unresolved borders, mutual mistrust, and a security-first approach that sidelines civilian agency. In Africa’s Great Lakes region, the Rwanda-DRC conflict is driven by deep ethnic fault lines and resource predation, entangled further by historical trauma and external interference. In Europe, the Russia-Ukraine war has become emblematic of power-based unilateralism in the face of collective security frameworks. These regions differ in their histories and geopolitical relevance, yet each reveals how fragile peace is when accountability is fragmented and international resolve is conditional. The lessons drawn from one theatre of conflict resonate in others—underscoring the urgent need for equitable, consistent, and context-sensitive approaches to conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction.",

    conclusion: [
      "The multiplicity of modern conflicts, whether in Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, or South Asia, signals a deep crisis in the global order’s ability to prevent violence, uphold sovereignty, and ensure justice. Despite the presence of regional organizations, international courts, and bilateral forums, enduring peace remains elusive where power politics override legal commitments and political expediency eclipses moral responsibility. The failures of mediation in the DRC, the stalemates in Kashmir and Ladakh, and the breakdown of deterrence in Ukraine all reflect a disconcerting erosion of collective security principles.",
      "Yet these crises also present an opportunity: to reevaluate peacebuilding as more than just ceasefires and border negotiations. Sustainable peace must include transitional justice, historical truth-telling, economic equity, and the centering of local voices in policymaking. International mechanisms, whether the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, the United Nations Security Council, or regional summits, must act not as reactive platforms but as proactive guarantors of international norms. Ultimately, peace cannot survive where impunity flourishes. Whether in Kinshasa, Kyiv, Srinagar, or Sikkim, the only enduring antidote to conflict lies in inclusive diplomacy, institutional integrity, and the unwavering political will to prioritize people over power.",

    intro: [
      "Across the world, 'ordinary' people are mounting extraordinary responses to the escalating ecological crises. Communities are extending alternatives to the paradigm of ‘development.’ One such alternative is India’s eco-swaraj movement—a decentralized, community-led model of EG and self-reliance. Eco-Swaraj offers a counter-narrative rooted in sustainability, equity, and participatory democracy.  Eco Swaraj, derived from the Gandhian principle of Swaraj, reinterprets environmental governance by emphasizing ecological sustainability rooted in community autonomy.  The term is used by Kothari to describe  hundreds of initiatives across India that are fighting destructive development. ",
      "In India, Eco Swaraj aligns closely with the goals of the 73rd Amendment, which institutionalized PRIs as vehicles of decentralized governance. Through this institutional framework, the MoRD  has been highly successful in states such as Kerala, Karnataka, etc., where it has been able to set up task forces. ",
      "Rethinking EG via the lens of eco-swaraj is increasingly relevant in South India, where rural populations are deeply dependent on local natural resources. In particular, these states have demonstrated notable progress by transferring significant powers in nature conservation to local governments through the PRIs. The region offers striking instances of how grassroots innovation, decentralized governance, and environmental justice converge, rooted in participatory ideals and reinforced by best practices. ",
      "This article  explores the philosophical roots and analyzes related policies, initiatives and case studies of Eco- Swaraj in South India through PRIs, assessing both successes and challenges. The study offers actionable insights and policy pathways that could pave the way toward a more equitable and environmentally resilient future.",

Rao Committee (1985) emphasized district-level planning and stronger Zila Parishads.  The V.N. Gadgil Committee (1988) called for constitutional status and fiscal powers for PRIs. These ideas finally led to the 73rd Amendment (1993), which institutionalized democratic decentralization—paving the way for Eco Swaraj and EG. The features of this act have pioneered democratic decentralization, which can be regarded as a step towards “Eco- Swaraj” and “environmental decentralization”.",

Karnataka Panchayati Raj Act 1993 includes provisions for natural resource management- the  state's Bhoomi land records system facilitates transparent environmental clearance.

    conclusion: [
      "The South Indian experience shows  eco-swaraj as a practical and developing framework for rethinking environmental governance and that there is no single model for successful environmental decentralization. Successful initiatives illustrate how ancient water systems, forgotten crops, and community forests are being reborn through local stewardship.  As India moves toward its climate commitments and SDGs the role of PRIs in environmental governance will become increasingly important. Eco-Swaraj holds promise for a truly sustainable and democratic EG where devolution of policy-making powers enables bottom-up experimentation, enhances citizen participation, and supports greater policy responsiveness.",
      "The 73rd Amendment has proven its significance in a short span of time,  enabling many villages to progress through environmental protection efforts.  Despite the challenges of uneven progress-  policy clarity, digital inclusion, institutional innovation can strengthen Panchayat -led ecological stewardship.  These echoes of Eco Swaraj inspire a larger movement — one that respects the land, the people, and their shared future.",

      "This article explores how social protection policies in low income countries are evolving especially in rural areas where poverty is persistent and complex. Using examples from countries like Pakistan, Ethiopia and Kenya the article shows how recent shifts especially after the pandemic are moving beyond short-term aid to more long-term investment approach. Additionally it discusses the often overlooked near poor and also provides recommendations to build an equitable system in policy making that will help the SDG agenda.",
      "It also tackles common challenges like poor infrastructure, weak institutional capacity and exclusion errors in targeting. The key argument here is that social protection needs to be more inclusive, flexible and grounded in people's actual needs not just their income level. By rethinking how we design and fund these systems, especially for groups on the edge of poverty we can build more resilient and fairer rural communities. ",

    intro: [
      "Rural poverty remains one of the most persistent and complex development challenges in low-income countries. Despite decades of targeted interventions, rural populations continue to experience disproportionately high levels of distress not only in terms of income, but also in access to education, healthcare, social services and opportunities for quality life. According to the World Bank, four out of five people living below the international poverty line reside in rural areas and poverty rates in these regions have declined at less than half the pace of urban areas over the past two decades (World Bank, 2022).",
      "Social protection policies have emerged as critical tools in the fight against rural poverty, offering pathways to resilience and human development through short-term relief and long-term structural support. While many low income countries have implemented programs such as conditional cash transfers, public works and food subsidies, their design and reach remain uneven. This article explores the impact of social protection policies on rural poverty, while rethinking inclusion frameworks through a multidimensional lens that moves beyond income based approach to address the vulnerability of groups like the near poor.",

        paragraphs: [
          "Globally, social protection has been increasingly recognized as central to achieving poverty reduction and inclusive development. However, rural areas continue to lag behind in both access to social services and the depth of support received. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the inadequacies of narrowly targeted systems and prompted a rethinking of protection mechanisms highlighting the need for adaptive, shock-responsive and more inclusive strategies. Against this backdrop the article reviews key policy shifts, examines sustainable financing approaches, identifies implementation challenges and makes forward-looking recommendations to strengthen social protection frameworks for rural populations, particularly the near poor. It also explores how well-designed and inclusive social protection programs can serve not only as safety nets but also as enablers of structural transformation addressing both income and non-income dimensions of poverty. The article also sheds light on policy frameworks through a critical lens looking at whom current systems serve, whom they leave out and what financing and design reforms are required to enhance long-term effectiveness.",

        paragraphs: [
          "The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the way people look at social protection systems. While the majority of low-income countries had limited welfare assistance with a focus on simply alleviating poverty, the pandemic prompted a wave of new policies to be established and expanded. Emergency responses, especially in rural areas, pushed governments to find new solutions, which reflected a new way of thinking that views social protection as not just assistance but also investment. This shift is especially visible in situations where governments sought to empower marginalized groups, like rural youth, as part of post-pandemic recovery strategies.",

        heading: "A. From Redistribution to Strategic Investment",
        paragraphs: [
          "James Midgley's (1999) theory of social investment provides an explanatory framework for understanding the developments in welfare systems during the pandemic. Instead of considering social protection as a reduction, Midgley prefers programs that are future-oriented, which aim to develop people's capacities, increase community assets, and encourage individuals to work. During the pandemic, many states echoed this approach as a great deal of the government investment went into health care, on-line learning, and cash payment, which resulted in extending social policy beyond mere wealth redistribution.",
          "It is very difficult to sustain these reforms in poor areas. According to Hofman (2020), the majority of developing countries had enormous financial and structural problems. Unlike advanced economies, they lacked the borrowing capacity and institutional frameworks to maintain large-scale welfare responses. High informality, weak health systems, and flight of capital left them particularly vulnerable, which reveals that investment-based protection remains aspirational without structural reform.",

        paragraphs: [
          "A prime example of a low-income nation seeking to span short-term crisis management and long-term development is that of Pakistan. As detailed in Ahmed’s policy brief COVID-19 Pandemic Recovery: Putting Youth of Pakistan at the Forefront, the government launched several initiatives specifically targeting rural youth, a group doubly impacted by education disruption and informal labor instability. The Kamyab Jawan Programme, for instance, combined entrepreneurship training, vocational skills development, and interest-free loans, which meant directly investing in youth employability outside formal systems (Ahmed, 2022, pp. 188–191).",
          "Another key initiative was the Corona Tiger Force, a volunteer platform that mobilized youth in public health outreach and service delivery. Although it was primarily designed for crisis response, the program also allowed youth in rural areas to take a direct role in governance and reconstruction, which reflects Midgley's focus on participation and community building. Thus, this involvement reflects a deeper trend: that certain policies of the pandemic era saw citizens not just as individuals being assisted but as agents actively engaged in development.",
          "In education, Pakistan introduced Matric-TECH streams, where general studies are combined with vocational and technical training and so, the aim was for these newly implemented streams to expand public labs and online skill training to allow young people to gain the required skills after the pandemic. Still, access challenges persisted: with only 51% smartphone penetration and rural women 38% less likely to own a device, which means that digital inclusion still remained a significant barrier to equitable protection, making it harder for everyone to gain equal opportunities (Ahmed, 2022, pp. 191–192).",
          "Lastly, these programs, although imperfect, represent a profound shift away from austerity welfare. However, Hofman’s (2020) broader critique reminds us that such innovations are constrained by fiscal space and international financial architecture. Pakistan, like many LMICs, remains exposed to debt pressures and donor dependency, which are problems that impose the boundaries to their institutionalization.",

        heading: "C. Toward a Broader Vision for Rural Protection",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Pakistani case study illustrates a significant evolution in the scope of social protection. With COVID-19 having transformed rural youth from an overlooked demographic into a central focus of recovery, the sustainability of this transformation depends on both national priorities and global support. As Hofman (2020) emphasises, without addressing underlying vulnerabilities, those being informality, weak infrastructure, limited fiscal autonomy, the pandemic-era developments will turn out to be temporary.",
          "So ultimately, the shift seen in Pakistan shows what is possible when a crisis generates inclusion. But to truly reduce rural poverty in low-income countries, this singular moment must not be treated as an exception, but as a model for future welfare design.",

Before the PSNP, the government relied on near-annual emergency policies for food aid, which failed to offer a sustainable solution for addressing food insecurity and led to a growing number of people requiring emergency assistance each year(Tadesse). In response, the government initiated the PSNP, co-funded by the World Bank, European Union and USAID. Aimed at breaking the cycle of dependence, it consists of  two main components–public works and direct support(Bishop and Hilhorst). The program has successfully created a labor market for unskilled workers that contributes to household asset building and supports the most vulnerable groups unable to engage in labor-intensive public works.

Kenya’s PPP with the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative regarding  the development of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) illustrates the benefits and potential downsides. While the SGR contributes to economic diversification and aligns with Kenya’s domestic priorities of infrastructure development and poverty reduction, 90% of its costs were financed by Chinese loans, increasing Kenyan debt, to 68% of its GDP (Himmer and Rod;World Bank 2025). With overly optimistic projections of profitability and inflated construction costs, the SGR faces limited potential for financial viability. This creates a cycle of dependence on Chinese funding and influence alongside unsustainable debt(Kell). This PPP ultimately undermines long-term poverty reduction goals. ",

          "While aid and partnership can be catalytic, sustainable financing requires establishing effective domestic tax systems. Domestic revenue mobilization preserves fiscal sovereignty and enables long-term poverty alleviation. However, it is often associated with increased tax rates to balance budgets which can challenge macroeconomic stability. To mitigate this, states have adopted alternative systems, particularly to address leakages. This includes tackling tax evasion, capital flight, and the contributions of the informal market. One example of a financing mechanism to leverage the informal market is Uruguay’s monotax. The system consolidates tax collection and social security contributions into a single payment, increasing government revenue.(WIEGO). In return it provides access to healthcare and retirement benefits,  incentivizing formalization(Ulrichs). Uruguay’s informal employment rate fell significantly, from 43% in 2001 to 21.5% in 2022, highlighting the long-term fiscal and social potential of such inclusive tax strategies(International Labour Organization).

Therefore, improving public expenditure efficiency through reallocation is as important as revenue generation. Egypt’s reform of fuel subsidies to fund social policies is an example. While fossil fuel subsidies maintained low consumer prices of petroleum products, they disproportionately  favored the wealthiest(World Resources Institute). The government redirected these funds towards targeted conditional (Takaful) and unconditional (Karama) cash transfers for poor women, children, orphans and widows. These programs aim at breaking cycles of intergenerational poverty by linking assistance to health and education requirements, thereby promoting human capital accumulation(World Bank Group 2020). ",

Despite policy advancements, a large segment of rural populations, especially informal workers, continues to be excluded from formal social protection systems. This exclusion is rooted in the structural design of most existing frameworks, which are historically oriented toward formal employment sectors. As a result, rural and agricultural workers, who often operate in informal, seasonal, or subsistence-based economies, are left unprotected (ILO, 2021). The failure to include these vulnerable groups undermines broader global goals, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), which calls for universal access to social protection for the poor and vulnerable.",

          "Several administrative and logistical barriers further inhibit access to social protection in rural areas. Geographic remoteness, lack of digital infrastructure, poor transportation, and bureaucratic red tape contribute to the inaccessibility of services. Many rural workers are not registered with government systems due to the absence of legal identity documentation or literacy in digital tools. These factors reinforce cycles of poverty and exclusion, rendering social protection policies ineffective where they are needed most (World Bank, 2020). In many regions, such as Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Pakistan, rural populations face an acute shortage of administrative infrastructure and service delivery channels. Digital divides, limited public awareness, and inadequate local governance mean that even where programs exist, people are simply unable to access or benefit from them in any meaningful way.",

Even where social protection policies exist on paper, the absence of monitoring mechanisms, especially in informal settings, allows non-compliance by employers and neglect of worker entitlements. Additionally, funding constraints, both at the national and community levels, restrict the scope and sustainability of many schemes. Governments in low-income countries often face trade-offs between investing in infrastructure, health, education, and social protection. Without stable and predictable financing, expansion of coverage remains elusive.

Inclusive policy design ensures that no one is left behind, aligning with the core philosophy of the SDGs.

When policies are co-created with the participation of marginalized communities, they become more responsive, context-specific, and sustainable.

For decades, governments focused on people living in extreme poverty and those who couldn't afford basic food, shelter, or healthcare. But now the ‘missing middle’ phenomenon has become particularly pronounced, where households earn too much to qualify for poverty targeted programs but lack sufficient resources to weather economic shocks or invest in long-term development. The first idea of near poverty was proposed by Mollie Orshansky. She defined the near poor as those living from 100 to 133 percent of the poverty threshold. ( A.S.P 2016 ) Unlike the extremely poor, the near-poor may have some assets, formal employment or education but these advantages can disappear quickly during economic downturns, health emergencies, or climate related disasters and they can easily slip into poverty.

Studies from India and other low and middle-income countries also show programs such as BPL based ration cards have experienced high exclusion errors and many deserving households are missing out due to outdated or inaccurate data.

All if not bleak as there are some programs that have addressed this issue. Community-based or hybrid targeting models like those used in Indonesia’s PNPM Mandiri have shown some success in identifying vulnerable households in a better manner (Alatas et al., 2012). Programs like Brazil’s Bolsa Família later restructured as Auxílio Brasil have  also demonstrated measurable reductions in multidimensional poverty. In addition to boosting household income the program increased school attendance, improved nutrition and reduced child mortality (Rasella et al., 2013). Similarly Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) offered a combination of cash and food for work that contributed to greater food security and improved health and education indicators especially among rural households (Berhane et al., 2014). These approaches are not only more responsive to local context but also better suited to capturing multidimensional forms of poverty as poverty is not merely about income.

The countries can also abide by the concept of “responsible graduation” that ensures social protection systems provide flexible support that allows for movement both out of and back into programs as circumstances change.

A World Bank report (2022) found that only 18% of the poorest rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa receive any form of formal social protection (International Labour Organization, 2020). Expanding coverage can help strengthen impact by adopting targeted and inclusive identification methods. In Malawi, for instance, the Social Cash Transfer Programme (SCTP) has demonstrated improved results by targeting ultra-poor and labor-constrained households, thereby ensuring that limited resources reach those in need (Government, 2024). Policies should also include vulnerable groups who are often excluded. Moreover, digital ID systems and mobile platforms can enhance outreach in remote areas (Musoni et al., 2023).",

For example, Rwanda’s Local Administrative Entities Development Agency (LODA) has shown how local control of social protection programs can improve responsiveness and monitoring (LODA, 2023). Additionally, predictable and diversified financing is essential. This includes allocating a dedicated percentage of GDP to social protection (Bierbaum & Schmitt, 2022).

In Sahel countries, the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program (SASPP) combines social safety nets with climate resilience tools, showing positive outcomes in food security and income diversification (Focus et al., 2023).

    conclusion: [
      "Social protection policies are essential to the pursuit of poverty reduction in low-income countries, particularly in rural areas where structural disadvantages persist. While existing programs have made progress in addressing extreme poverty, they often fail to account for the precarious position of the near poor and the multidimensional nature of rural deprivation. Income-based targeting methods, though common, leave many vulnerable households unsupported, especially during periods of crisis or transition. Importantly, social protection does more than alleviate poverty, it also enables rural development. When effectively implemented, it strengthens local economies through better living conditions, improves school attendance and health outcomes and reduces harmful coping strategies like child labor or debt. These spillover effects contribute to stronger rural institutions, enhanced human capital and long term development gains, that help build a resilient community. A shift toward inclusive and multidimensionally aware policies is not only necessary it is urgent. Without it rural poverty will remain deep rooted and broader goals of sustainable and equitable development will continue to fall short.",

    abstract: [
      `Urbanisation is no longer a choice but a condition of the 21st century. With over half the world’s population now living in cities—and much of that growth concentrated in the Global South—the question is not whether cities will expand, but whether they will do so equitably, sustainably, and humanely. This research reimagines cities as not just engines of economic growth but as ecosystems of care, coexistence, and collective well-being. Against the backdrop of infrastructural decay, informal settlements, and deepening inequalities, this paper proposes a reframing of "smart cities"—not as technologically saturated spaces but as inclusive, adaptive, and just habitats that respond to the needs of all, not just the privileged few.`,
      `Drawing on the metaphor of legacy cities as outdated cars, the paper calls for a deep structural overhaul rather than superficial digital upgrades. Smartness, it argues, must be infused with empathy, equity, and sustainability. Case studies from India, Colombia, Kenya, Austria, and South Africa illustrate how data-driven technologies and nature-based solutions can transform access to basic services such as water, transport, safety, and sanitation—particularly in marginalised urban zones.`,
      `At the core is the proposed 3A Framework: infrastructure must be Adaptive to climate and systemic shocks, Accessible to historically excluded communities, and Agile enough to evolve with dynamic urban needs. The study critiques how dominant urban models marginalise the lived experiences of women, LGBTQIA+ persons, migrants, and non-human species by prioritising top-down, technocratic planning.`,
      `Gender-inclusive planning, the integration of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), and recognition of animal life as part of urban ecosystems emerge as critical pillars of inclusive smart cities. From Pune’s trans-inclusive toilets to Nairobi’s digital literacy for LGBTQIA+ youth and Jaipur’s humane animal control programs, the study documents how cities can be reimagined as sites of belonging and dignity.`,
      `The research also calls for transforming urban governance into a co-governed, multi-actor process that breaks down institutional silos and embeds ethics in planning. Ultimately, it presents a blueprint for building cities in the Global South that are not only digitally enabled, but emotionally, socially, and ecologically intelligent. It asks: What if smart cities were not just about better tools—but better values?`,

          "Smart Cities, Smarter Futures: Building Inclusive Infrastructure",
        paragraphs: [
          `Cities have long been considered the engines of economic growth. “Over 80% of global economic activity is concentrated in cities. And there is no country that has ever reached middle income status without urbanizing, and none has reached high income status without vibrant cities” (Mohieldin, 2017).`,
          `Yet today, cities are increasingly struggling to keep pace with the pressures of rapid urbanisation. An apt analogy can help explain this. Think of cities as cars built in the 1960s—originally designed for fewer passengers, basic roads & slower speeds. Over time, they’ve been retrofitted, patched, and pushed to perform in high-pressure conditions, but without major upgrades, they sputter under modern demands. Just as a vintage car needs a new engine, sensors, GPS, and fuel efficiency to run today, our cities too need smart infrastructure, data integration, and inclusive design to serve 21st-century populations. This, in essence, is what defines a smart city, an urban ecosystem that leverages technology and inclusive planning to deliver sustainable and resilient living for all.`,
          `Defining Smart Cities in the Global South Context`,
          `“A smart city is the effective integration of physical, digital, and human systems in the built environment to deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens” (British Standards Institution, 2014). In the Global South, this concept means more than technology; it promises real transformation in how cities serve their most vulnerable residents. It uses modern technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), ICT (Information & Communication Technology), sensors & analysed data to optimize city operations, be it energy, water, transport or governance.`,
          `Challenges Faced by Legacy Urban Systems`,
          `Firstly, high rates of unregulated urban sprawl—unplanned, low-density & uncontrolled expansion of urban areas into previously undeveloped rural or suburban areas—have burdened these areas and their already stressed components (United Nations, 2024). Secondly, severe infrastructure deficits: about 60% of cities in the Global South are facing infrastructure limitations (Altala, 2025). Thirdly, growing slum populations: it is estimated that 1 in every 3 residents of urban areas in the Global South live in informal settlements or slums (Altala, 2025). In 2022, 1.12 billion urban residents lived in slums—25% of city dwellers, with numbers rising most in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (United Nations, 2025). Fourth, exclusion of citizens from accessing public services: globally, just 44% of urban residents live within a 400 m radius of open public spaces and only 40% of the urban population in least developed countries has easy access to public transport (United Nations, 2025). Fifth, waste & drainage system failures: multi storeyed waste dumps & waterlogging events are now common problems in metropolitan cities like Delhi.`,
          `Smart City Solutions: Addressing Legacy Urban Deficits`,
          `The traditional idea of smart cities has often focused narrowly on digitisation, automated traffic lights, surveillance cameras, and data dashboards. However, this approach is far too limited. Smart infrastructure must go beyond mere technology, to offer a transformative upgrade—but only when designed with inclusion and resilience at its core. As UN-Habitat (2022) aptly observed, “Data alone doesn’t make a city smart—what matters is whether it listens, adapts, and includes.”`,
          `Digital platforms and community-generated data will help map underserved areas, identify stress points, and prioritise resource allocation. This will ensure that informal settlements, which are often excluded from master plans, receive targeted and timely infrastructure upgrades. For instance, Delhi’s urban heat-mapping project used AI and satellite imagery to identify vulnerable zones in slums and inform heat-resilience planning (SEEDS India, 2022). Real-time monitoring through IoT & sensors will enable proactive detection of water leaks, drainage blockages, or power failures. It will allow instant response before they escalate into crises. This will minimise service downtime & disaster risk, especially in vulnerable neighbourhoods. Indore, for example, has installed IoT sensors in over 300 public toilets to monitor hygiene, odour, and water levels, ensuring timely maintenance and public health safety (Smart Cities Mission, 2023). Smart transit systems and inclusive public spaces will use mobility data and citizens’ feedback to design accessible, gender-sensitive, and climate-resilient mobility options. This will further promote social equity. Cape Town’s MyCiTi transit system exemplifies this by using universal design, gender-separated facilities, and step-free infrastructure to improve access for all (Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, 2021).`,
          `The 3A Framework: A Model for Inclusive Urban Resilience`,
          `Building on the principles of established models like the Smart–Green–Resilient framework used in Hong Kong for sustainable urban planning (ResearchGate, 2022), and the Smart–Resilience–Sustainability triangle from Cañavera Herrera et al. (2022), the 3A framework—Adaptive, Accessible & Agile—offers a practical approach for Global South cities seeking truly inclusive smart infrastructure. Infrastructure should be adaptive, using real-time data and sensor technology to anticipate and respond to urban challenges like flooding, power outages, or traffic congestion. It must be accessible, reaching marginalized communities, informal settlements, and persons with disabilities through equitable service delivery, universal design, and language-inclusive digital platforms. Finally, it must be agile—integrating climate-resilient and nature-based solutions such as sponge pavements, decentralized energy systems, and modular housing that can evolve with urban needs. Together, these three pillars ensure that smart infrastructure is not only efficient, but also equitable and resilient in the face of dynamic urban pressures.`,
          `So just upgrading legacy cities is not a luxury—it’s imperative. Smart infrastructure must go beyond digital shine to serve slums, informal labor hubs, and marginalized zones. Policymakers must invest in data-driven upgrades, embed equity at design stage, and foster community co-creation. Only then will our Global South cities run like modern, inclusive engines—fit for both economic growth and social resilience.`,

        heading: "Sustainable Infrastructure: A Pressing Priority",
        paragraphs: [
          `In an era of accelerating climate change and rapid urbanization, investing in sustainable infrastructure is more important now than ever before. As the world faces a climate crisis and global economic slowdown, the need to address inequalities that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people rises rapidly. When we talk about the Infrastructure-79% of global greenhouse gas emissions are related to infrastructure. 4% growth in global GDP by 2030 is possible with clean energy investments. 92% of SDG targets are achievable through infrastructure investment. `,
          `India and South Asian countries are significantly advancing infrastructure development to support inclusive growth and climate resilience. India's Rs. 108 trillion, National Infrastructure Pipeline, focuses on roads, metros, energy, and digital systems, with highways and urban transit expanding rapidly. South Asia faces a $2.5 trillion infrastructure gap, but targeted investments—such as smart ports, energy storage, and rural connectivity—are helping bridge it. These efforts are vital to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring long-term regional development. Sustainable urbanization is the key to development in low- and middle-income countries, addressing rural-urban needs, reducing poverty, and protecting ecosystems. Proper urban planning can boost jobs, growth, and inclusion while reducing pollution and resource use.`,
          `IDB Principles of Sustainable Infrastructure`,
          ` The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) considered the global principles on sustainable infrastructure and highlighted its four dimensions:Economic and Fiscal Sustainability; Social Sustainability; Environmental Sustainability; and Institutional Sustainability.`,
          `Infrastructure 4.0`,
          `Buildings are responsible for 40% of global energy consumption and 33% of GHG emissions, making it a critical aspect of infrastructure systems. By integrating advanced technologies, practices, and materials, infrastructure planning can significantly reduce consumption and associated GHG emissions. Efficient lighting, smart grids technology, and efficient HVAC systems are just a few examples of how infrastructure can maximize efficiency while minimizing operational costs.`,
          `In 2010, the Singapore-ETH Centre began researching efficient indoor climate solutions suited for Singapore’s hot and humid conditions. At the Future Cities Lab, they developed a three-part cooling system:`,
          `Separation of cooling and dehumidifying – Sensible (heat) and latent (moisture) cooling are treated separately to reduce energy use, allowing heat removal at higher temperatures (up to 18°C) through radiative cooling using cold surfaces, instead of traditional air-based (convective) systems.`,
          `Water-based heat transport – Replacing air with water for heat transport improves efficiency and enables smaller, easily integrated pipes, reducing the need for bulky ceilings or floors.`,
          `Decentralized ventilation – Small, room-based ventilation units draw in and dehumidify outdoor air, removing the need for centralized air distribution systems and saving space.`,
          `Together, these innovations enhance energy efficiency, save space, and improve comfort in tropical climates.`,
          `A Cost-Effective Path to Sustainable and Resilient Cities: Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) offer climate-resilient, cost-effective urban infrastructure. Examples include floodable parks in Bangkok and green roofs in Singapore. NBS reduces costs by 42% and delivers co-benefits like cleaner air, biodiversity, and well-being while supporting other sustainable systems like energy and mobility.`,
          `Living infrastructure: Living infrastructure—green, blue, and grey systems—enhances urban resilience by delivering ecological, social, and economic benefits. Examples like urban forests and wetlands offer cooling, carbon capture, and habitat support. Canberra’s case highlights global strategies for integrating nature-based solutions into sustainable urban renewal and planning.`,
          `IoT in Urban Development: The MDPI review highlights how IoT enhances Green Storm water Infrastructure by integrating sensors, data communication, and automated controls—like smart rain barrels, green roofs, and bioretention systems—for real-time water quantity and quality management. Examples include soil-moisture sensors and RTC-controlled detention ponds, boosting efficiency and flood resilience.`,

        heading: `Urban Governance 2.0: Harnessing Actors and Innovations for Resilient and Sustainable Cities `,
        paragraphs: [
          `Urban governance refers to the mechanisms, institutions, and processes through which diverse stakeholders manage urban affairs. It extends beyond formal government to include networks of civil society, private sector actors, and international agencies (UN-Habitat, 2002). With over 55% of the world’s population residing in cities, effective urban governance has become essential for addressing issues such as unplanned urbanization, infrastructure stress, environmental degradation, and inequality (Pierre, 2011; Satterthwaite, 2005). Governance quality directly influences service delivery, social inclusion, and urban resilience. `,
          `However, challenges like corruption, institutional fragmentation, and the exclusion of marginalized populations persist, particularly in the Global South (Roy, 2005; Mitlin & Satterthwaite, 2013). This research proposal explores the structural dynamics, actor interactions, and challenges of urban governance. It aims to examine how participatory mechanisms and inclusive frameworks can be applied to create more sustainable and equitable urban environments, with comparative case studies drawn from diverse global contexts.`,
          `The literature on urban governance identifies it as a multi-level, multi-actor process that extends beyond the traditional state apparatus. Pierre (2011) emphasizes the importance of networked governance, where decision-making involves public-private partnerships and citizen engagement. UN-Habitat (2002) outlines governance principles such as equity, accountability, efficiency, and civic participation. Roy (2005) critiques urban planning for often ignoring informal settlements and calls for recognizing urban informality as a governance issue. Mitlin & Satterthwaite (2013) argue that urban poverty is closely tied to governance failures in service delivery and inclusion. Hollands (2008) highlights the role of smart city innovations, but warns of deepening digital divides. `,
          `Scholars like Wampler (2007) advocate participatory budgeting as a means of democratizing local governance. Despite this, challenges like institutional fragmentation, elite capture, and lack of transparency persist. The literature reveals both the potential and pitfalls of current urban governance practices, providing a foundation for this study. `,
          `Key Elements of Urban Governance`,
          `Effective urban governance is built upon several key principles:`,
          `Participation: Inclusive governance ensures that citizens, especially marginalized groups, hav.e a voice in decision-making. Tools like participatory budgeting increase accountability (Wampler, 2007).`,
          `Decentralization: Local governments gain flexibility and responsiveness when authority is devolved from central administrations (Smoke, 2015).`,
          `Transparency and Accountability: Open governance practices, such as public access to budgets and planning documents, reduce corruption and enhance trust (UNDP, 1997; Pierre, 2011).`,
          `Rule of Law: Effective governance relies on strong institutions and legal frameworks to enforce regulations, especially in land use and urban planning (UN-Habitat, 2002).`,
          `Strategic Planning: Integrated urban planning aligns land use, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability goals (Healey, 2006).`,
          `Major Actors in Urban Governance`,
          `Local governments: Local government are key implementers of urban policies and services (Pierre, 2011). `,
          `Private sector: The private sector contributes through investments and infrastructure partnerships (Payne, 2005). `,
          `Civil society and NGOs: Civil society and NGOs advocate for marginalized groups (Miraftab, 2004).`,
          `International organizations: International organizations like UN-Habitat and the World Bank offer frameworks and funding. The interaction among these actors defines the effectiveness of urban governance.`,
          `Challenges of Urban Governance`,
          `Rapid Urbanization: Unplanned population growth overwhelms infrastructure, housing, and basic services (Satterthwaite, 2005).`,
          `Informality: Many urban residents live in informal settlements, which lie outside regulatory frameworks and are often excluded from official planning (Roy, 2005).`,
          `Exclusion and Inequality: Poor and marginalized groups frequently lack representation in urban policy processes (Mitlin & Satterthwaite, 2013).`,
          `Environmental Degradation: Poor planning and weak enforcement contribute to pollution, deforestation, and vulnerability to climate change (Bulkeley & Betsill, 2003).`,
          `Corruption and Weak Institutions: Lack of transparency and institutional inefficiency undermine trust and hinder effective service delivery (UNDP, 1997).`,
          `Innovations and Solutions in Urban Governance`,
          `Smart city initiatives leverage ICTs for better urban service delivery (Hollands, 2008). Participatory budgeting allows citizens to allocate public funds (Wampler, 2007). Public-private partnerships (PPPs) enhance infrastructure development (World Bank, 2015). Inclusive planning integrates slums and informal sectors (UN-Habitat, 2003).`,
          `Innovative Practices and Global Models`,
          `•	Participatory budgeting (Brazil, Portugal)`,
          `•	Digital platforms for city feedback (e.g., FixMyStreet, Decidim)`,
          `•	Smart city governance (Seoul, Tallinn)`,
          `•	Urban climate adaptation networks (e.g., C40 Cities, 100 Resilient Cities)`,
          `•	Inclusive slum upgrading projects (e.g., Pune, Cape Town)`,
          `Urban governance must be adaptive, inclusive, and transparent to meet the challenges of 21st-century urbanization. Effective coordination between actors and strategic planning is key to sustainable development. Future governance models should prioritize participation and social justice.`,

        heading: `Political Inclusion: A Catalyst for Equitable Urban Planning and Effective Public Service Delivery `,
        paragraphs: [
          `Exclusion of migrants from decision-making in their host community often limits their access to certain public goods, highlighting a common issue migrants face in participating in local governance. The migration of people seeking better livelihoods has led to rapid urbanization within and between countries, leading to intense competition for limited resources and affecting public service delivery (World Migration Report, 2015). Elections, which are the foundation of a democratic system, provide an avenue for citizens to choose their representatives.  While a significant portion of urban populations consists of migrants (migration data, 2022), they are often ineligible to vote for their representatives or compete for principal positions. How citizens are represented directly impacts their satisfaction (Metwally & Samir, 2024), giving governments insights on how to improve the experiences of different demographic groups with public services. According to Alba and Foner (2015), the level of representation of individuals with a migrant background is a key indicator of a society’s inclusion capacity. It is also vital for communities to create channels or policies for immigrants to voice their concerns.`,
          `Research has been conducted on the political representation and participation of migrants, exploring how migration politics are played out (Gherghina and Basaraba, 2024; Zogu & Schonthaler, 2023). As the share of the world’s population living in urban areas is expected to increase by 60% in 2030 (United Nations, 2018), urban planning should therefore be a priority for governments in addressing societal issues. Town planners have often ignored the issue of migrant populations, which has often jeopardized the effective delivery of public services (Patel, Patel & Tailor, 2024). The political inclusion of migrants in decision-making is essential for urban planning to ensure equitable access to public services.`,
          `The lack of participation of migrants in decision-making has created inequality between migrants and the indigenous people of such communities (International Organization for Migration, n.d.). The idea that a better life is available elsewhere and that moving can help reduce the differences between their situation and that of people in more prosperous areas is common. However, migrants often face the harsh reality that they may have unequal access to rights and public resources. While local governments play a significant role in making sure urban areas are inclusive, many people in large urban populations still lack access to adequate public resources (World Migration Report, 2015), most of whom are migrants because they are new to the environment. `,
          `In low-income settings such as communities in the global south, rapid urbanization can lead to high levels of inaccessible infrastructure, housing shortages, and service gaps, placing pressure on local governments and national agencies due to congestion. This can bring a positive outcome if properly managed through collective governance, it can boost economic growth in the urban area (World Migration Report, 2015). `,
        ],
      },
      {
        heading: `Gender Inclusion: Rethinking Participation, Presence, and Power`,
        paragraphs: [
          `In the rapidly urbanising landscapes of the Global South, where digitization and smart infrastructures are reshaping the contours of our day-to-day lives; a conventional  question remains unnoticed: Who exactly are our cities being designed for? While the adjectives from inclusivity such as  “equity, access, diversity” have found way into urban policy discourses and academia, the ground realities often speak a different story. `,
          `Smart cities in the postcolonial contexts like India, are still largely imagined and executed through a masculine lens. In this top-down architecture of decision-making, the everyday needs, routines, vulnerabilities, and aspirations of women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, children, and those living at the intersections of marginalisation are too often left out of the blueprint.`,
          `It is pertinent to note that urban environments are never colourless of the prejudice or value judgments they hold. Each crosswalk, streetlamp, public washroom, and metro line is a reflection of planning choices… choices that reveal whose safety, dignity, and freedom are prioritised over others. For instance, consider the case of a woman returning home from work late in the evening. Here, the absence of adequate lighting, lack of surveillance, or unsafe commuting options, inaccessible helpline institutions, etc, amongst others, fundamentally reshape her relationship with the city. Similarly, a trans individual attempting to access a digital health portal may find themselves excluded by design through systems that assume binary gender, or by platforms that require formal documentation many do not possess. How many google survey forms, or University admission portals have the ‘Other’ option if not for the ones who do not identify in the social construct of gender identities. `,
          `The UN Women, 2021 Report observes that nearly 90% of women on public transport face some sort of harassment while more than 50% trans individuals refused healthcare reporting due to constrains and prejudiced value judgement about their gender identities.  `,
          `Thus, the issue is not unilinear or just about visibility; it is about infrastructure being complicit in exclusion. What is often termed as ‘smartness’ in cities- automated transport corridors, surveillance policing, or digital governance may actually deepen existing inequalities when designed without gender sensitivity. Digital public services that assume universal smartphone access or financial autonomy fail to account for the gendered digital divide, especially among lower-income communities.`,
          `To challenge this, urban inclusion must move beyond symbolic gestures or isolated interventions. A few interconnected domains demand urgent attention: `,
          `Mobility and safety`,
          `More than just surveillance, cities must ensure emotionally safe and physically navigable public spaces. Lighting, transport frequency, and inclusive signage can transform how marginalised genders move through space. `,
          `For example; Vienna in its ‘Gender Mainstreaming in Urban Planning’ initiative redesigned sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, lighting, and park layouts to better reflect how women and children use public space. Sidewalks were widened after data showed women tended to walk more with children or groceries. Lighting was adjusted to enhance nighttime visibility in underused areas. (UN-Habitat, 2012).`,
          `Bogota, Columbia under its ‘Safe Cities for Women’ program, the city reconfigured bus stops, increased security presence on the Trans Milenio Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, and introduced women-only buses during peak hours to reduce harassment. Notably, complaint hotlines and response units led to a 21% increase in harassment reports, improving institutional responsiveness (UN Women, 2020).`,
          `Seoul implemented gender-sensitive transport design by adding surveillance, emergency bells, and pink parking zones near exits for late-night commuters. The city also introduced “safe return home” apps integrated with real-time CCTV monitoring and community policing.`,
          `Health and sanitation`,
          `Inclusive design must incorporate the bodily realities of menstruation, pregnancy, and transition. The absence of clean and secure restrooms, for instance, disproportionately impacts those already made vulnerable by their social identities.`,
          `Pune, India: Pune's “Toilet for Her” project built and maintained gender-segregated, safe, well-lit public toilets that were also trans-inclusive, with sanitary napkin dispensers, ramps, and CCTV. A maintenance partnership with women’s self-help groups ensured sustainability (Jain, 2021). Cape Town, South Africa: In informal settlements, the Sanitation in Informal Settlements Program (SISP) emphasized communal toilets designed to protect women and LGBTQIA+ individuals from assault, with solar lighting, surveillance, and water access (World Bank, 2018).`,
          `San Francisco, USA: Introduced all-gender public restrooms across city facilities, including public libraries, government buildings, and parks, following the “Gender Inclusion Policy”. The program also mandates signage that is non-binary and uses inclusive language like “All Genders Welcome.”`,
          `Digital Inclusion`,
          `A digitally enabled city cannot be built on the backs of those digitally excluded. Access to affordable data, platform literacy, and the ability to participate in digital governance must be seen as gender justice issues.`,
          `Nairobi, Kenya: Initiated digital literacy drives through community internet kiosks in low-income areas. Special modules for LGBTQIA+ youth covered digital safety, reporting online abuse, and accessing health or legal services anonymously (Digital Rights Foundation, 2019). Kerala, India: Through Kudumbashree, a women-led poverty eradication program, digital literacy was embedded into urban planning at the ward level. Over 4.3 million women were digitally trained, enabling gender-responsive budgeting and access to services (Government of Kerala, 2020).`,
          `Barcelona, Spain: The “Decidim” participatory platform allows residents to engage in digital consultations, budgeting, and infrastructure feedback. The platform is explicitly coded for equity, with anonymised inputs and digital accessibility standards to avoid biases against marginalised genders or illiterate users (Barandiaran et al., 2020).`,
          `Housing and spatial ownership `,
          `Urban living must support autonomy and agency. Safe rental options, gender-inclusive shelters, and housing cooperatives can provide more than a roof, they can offer freedom and belonging.`,
          `Vienna, Austria: The “Gemeindebauten” social housing model integrates participatory planning, mixed-income residents, and gender-neutral allocation policies. Women-led housing co-ops are prioritised, and building design ensures shared courtyards and safe entryways (UN-Habitat, 2012).`,
          `However, the real shift lies in reclaiming who holds the pen in planning processes. Participation means power. Women and LGBTQIA+ persons must not only be consulted but placed within the core decision-making architecture, defining priorities, shaping budgets, and evaluating success. And crucially, their voices must be heard not as a monolith but in their rich diversity marked by intersections of class, caste, religion, disability, and age.`,
          `There are models to learn from, though not to copy blindly. Still, it’s worth remembering that no imported model will work without deep contextual understanding. Inclusive smart cities cannot be engineered from above. They must emerge from listening, co-creating, and rethinking what success means in urban life.`,
          `Ultimately, at stake is not just access to services or digital tools, it is the fundamental right to belong in, shape, and transform the city. A truly smart city is not one filled with sensors and apps, but one where every resident, regardless of identity, can live with dignity, security, and voice.`,

        heading: `Building Minds, Not Just Cities: Integrating Mental Health and Psychosocial Support`,
        paragraphs: [
          `In South Asia, urbanization is occurring at an alarming rate, with megacities such as Dhaka, Mumbai, and Karachi experiencing significant changes due to the implementation of metro rail services, expressway development, and the redevelopment of mass housing (WHO, 2022). Such infrastructural improvements, which are integrated with the plans of a smart city, will benefit the efficiency of transportation, access to housing, and economic viability (UN-Habitat, 2020). Nevertheless, because of these advancements, the marginalized communities and existing informal settlements are usually displaced, thus causing extreme imbalances in their social and psychological health (Cernea, 2000; Srinivasan and Nuthalapati, 2020).`,
          `Displacement not only implies a change of residence; it destroys social bonds, familial connections, and emotional attachments, particularly in helpless populations like women, older people, and youth (Bhugra & Becker, 2005; Fernandez, 2014). Although most of the projects have provisions of financial compensation or housing options, most are inadequate to record the long-term impacts of the psychological health effects caused by the trauma of resettlement (Lakshman & Rajan, 2023).`,
          `The AECom landscape in infrastructure planning is just one of the symptoms of a larger policy silo: the mental health is ignored by the agencies of the urban development and transport ministries that center their work on engineering and logistics, and the domain of psychosocial care is almost always assigned to underfunded and overstretched health ministries (Saxena et al., 2007; WHO, 2014). It is the argument made in this paper to incorporate Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) services into planning, implementing, and following up infrastructure projects to re-conceptualize the view of development as not merely a physical, but an anthropocentric adaptation of resilience (Patel, 2007).`,
          `Urban development causes forced displacement, which is a significant factor in the psychological distress of victims, though it has received less theorization in the policy of infrastructure (Cernea, 2000). The studies conducted in South Asian settings indicated that forced evictions and relocations in slums create social alienation, depression, and collapse of community trust (Bardhan et al., 2015, 2009; Amzad, 2019). It is even worse when relocation entails removing the residents to new places that are miles away from their initial neighborhoods, thus breaking the connection to work, education, and social interactions (Das, 2015). `,
          `The nature of development-induced displacement (DID) provides a rationale behind the idea that development projects that can be conceived as either economically or otherwise beneficial may ultimately cause involuntary traumas where the so-called protections never tackle the occurrence of non-economic losses to identity, place and a sense of psychological stability (Vanclay & Kemp, 2017; Kothari, 2003). It has also been reported in the studies that post-traumatic stress-like symptoms, anxiety, and somatic concerns are higher in communities that have faced forced displacement due to infrastructure development, especially when the support mechanisms of the community fail (Ager & Strang, 2008; Jain & Jadhav, 2008). `,
          `International guidelines on mental health and psychosocial support, such as IASC Guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings (2007) and UNHCR Operational Guidance on Refugees (2013), present a clear roadmap on how to include mental health in the response to complex emergencies and forced migration. This has been difficult to apply to the situation of what might be called development contexts, such as the construction of roads or mass resettlement schemes, in which the psychological impact is equally drastic (Miller & Rasmussen, 2010; IFRC, 2018). `,
          `The World Health Organization has underlined that the state of mental health is defined by factors of housing stability, income security, access to education, and community cohesion, all of which are disrupted by forced relocation (WHO, 2014). Besides, Patel (2007) and Desjarlais et al. (1995) have demonstrated that psychosocial effects of urban displacement cannot be addressed by psychosocial systems in the low and middle-income countries (LMICs) to which South Asia belongs. This exposes communities who are displaced to protracted emotional distress, particularly due to a lack of formal support systems. `,
          `Policy Design and Key Elements`,
          `This paper suggests that to prevent the psychosocial vulnerability to the infrastructure-led displacement, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) should be incorporated throughout the different stages of the public infrastructure project implementation (IASC, 2007; Oswald et al., 2024). They are the stages before the displacement, assistance during the moving process, and follow-up after the displacement.`,
          `During the pre-displacement stage, institutionalization of proactive communication and psychosocial preparedness is necessary (Bhan, 2009). The community members must be involved in consultations not only about the planned logistic schedules but also about emotional and social disturbance (Das, 2015). Screening at the baseline would be able to determine prior vulnerabilities at the level of communities, particularly those at high risk, including women, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities (WHO, 2022).`,
          `When relocating, infrastructure projects must incorporate physical counseling services and mobile mental health units on-site to get direct assistance (UNHCR, 2013; IFRC, 2018). These services may assist people to overcome the trauma caused by relocation, incuring the prospective threat of psychological damages which could otherwise be long-term. Breakdown in social cohesion can be counteracted effectively through community-based interventions like the creation of safe places of collective expression, support groups, etc. (Ager & Strang, 2008; Jain & Jadhav, 2008).`,
          `The long-term monitoring and follow-up evaluation are important in the post-displacement stage as a way of evaluating and meeting the psychosocial needs (Miller & Rasmussen, 2010). Women-led organizations of peer support were found to foster community resilience and maintain mental health through promotion (Amzad, 2020). MHPSS can be integrated in primary care in resettlement locations, and this enables access to care and support continuity (Saxena et al., 2007). To ensure institutionalized interventions, it is necessary to revise Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) to contain psychosocial risk indicators (Chen et al., 2022). MHPSS provisions should be obligated by international funding agencies like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank during the eligibility conditions of projects in the frameworks of ESG (ADB, 2022). The local governments can coordinate NGOs and academic institutes to implement this model and customize services to cultural and contextual requirements (Jain & Jadhav, 2008).`,
          `Institutional Roles and Stakeholders`,
          `Synergetic incorporation of the stakeholders is imperative in the successful integration of MHPSS in infrastructure projects. Infrastructure projects are mostly undertaken by the urban development and transport ministries, which have little to no mandate and expertise in dealing with psychosociological outcomes (UN-Habitat, 2020). Therefore, ministries of health, which are in a better position to plan and manage MHPSS programs, should make mental health an issue to be shared collectively (Patel et al., 2007).`,
          `The local governments play an important middle-level role, particularly in the mobilisation of communities and in the last-mile service delivery (Kumar & Singh, 2022). Culturally competent counseling, awareness-building sessions, and social support networks could be offered through NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) that have set up work in informal settlements in urban areas (Siddiki, 2024).`,
          `Financial support and guidance as MHPSS interventions can come in the form of international development agencies like the World Bank, ADB, and UN-Habitat (ADB, 2022; UN-Habitat, 2020). Donor agencies also contribute to determining social safeguard standards as well as providing incentives for the adoption of policies. Institutions of higher learning and mental health practitioners will be instrumental in the formulation of context-responsive assessment playbooks and carrying out rigorous impact assessments (Cosgrove et al., 2020).`,
          `Obstacles and Constraints`,
          `Although this policy shows the promise of transformation, it is subject to a number of structural and operational issues. One is that institutional barriers to coordination have been perpetuated by the ongoing siloing of the sectors (health, housing, and transport) (Saxena et al., 2007). The inclusion of MHPSS in infrastructure projects would also involve political efforts at the top level and the redesigning of institutions (Patel et al., 2018). Second, South Asian culture places a lot of stigma on mental health and thus, usually underreports and is not willing to seek support (Jain & Jadhav, 2008). Community work and policy priorities may then be impeded by such a social stigma. Third, the region lacks adequately trained mental health professionals, and few can be used to deliver the programs on a large scale (WHO, 2014). Fourth, mental health risk indicators are not required in some of the available tools used to design projects, like ESIs, leaving gaps in risk analysis (World Bank, 2021). Lastly, the donor conditionalities are subject to inconsistency or half-baked implementation, and this also pertains to the sustainability of MHPSS integration (ADB, 2022).`,
          `Suggestions and Strategic Solutions`,
          `A number of action steps can be useful in solving these challenges. First, inter-ministerial task forces should be put in place to ensure planning of infrastructure and health at the onset (UN-Habitat, 2020). The existing regulatory frameworks can be reviewed in such a way that MHPSS should be included in both ESIA and RAP guidance (World Bank, 2021).`,
          `To deal with stigma, awareness has to be part of the project outreach, within the outreach as well as culturally appropriate communication strategies (Jain & Jadhav, 2008). They are supposed to be co-developed by the local stakeholders to be relevant and acceptable.`,
          `Limited human resources may be alleviated by providing training on the basics of psychosocial support and trauma-informed care to paraprofessionals (e.g., community health workers and peer educators) (IFRC, 2018). Such cadres have the potential to provide services in underserved places and gain trust among the communities.`,
          `Governments and donors would be well-advised to invest in the pilot projects testing the viability and effectiveness of MHPSS integration in cities such as Dhaka, Mumbai, or Colombo to establish empirical evidence (Kanai, & Schindler, 2022). These pilots ought to have systems of monitoring and evaluation to create data on scaling up.`,
          `In the effort of South Asian cities turning towards smart and sustainable development, it is also important that they need to embark on socially responsible and psychologically astute urban planning. Incorporation of mental health into construction activities makes the process of displacement a smooth one, rather than an ordeal that violates human dignity and well-being (Oswald et al., 2024).`,
          `Such a policy is novel and consistent with other international structures, including SDG 3 (Health and Well-being), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) (UNDP, 2020). South Asia has the opportunity to show the way in creating not only smart, but also emotionally resilient cities of the future through incorporating MHPSS into the governance of infrastructure.`,

        heading: `Coexistence, Not Control: Welfare of the voiceless`,
        paragraphs: [
          `In the ever-growing sprawl of modern cities, there is one presence that continues to be rendered invisible: animals. From stray dogs navigating traffic in Indian metros to urban monkeys adapting to shrinking forests, animals have long been part of human settlements. And yet, urban planning continues to treat them as afterthoughts, or as problems to be eliminated. `,
          `This omission is not coincidental. It reflects a larger view of cities as purely human domains, built for productivity, commerce, and control. In such a view, the presence of animals, be it dogs, cattle, birds, or urban wildlife, is framed as disruptive. The aspiration for a “clean” and “smart” city becomes synonymous with exclusion—of disorder, unpredictability, and species deemed inconvenient.`,
          `However, this understanding is fast becoming outdated. Urban ecosystems are deeply entangled, and our relationship with non-human species is not merely ecological, it is cultural, moral, and, increasingly, political. Across the Global South, animals are not peripheral; they are part of lived urban life, linked to livelihoods, religious practices, waste systems, and even emotional wellbeing. `,
          `Take the example of Jaipur, which has introduced community feeding zones, sterilisation initiatives, and GPS-enabled monitoring for stray dog populations. While not without flaws, these efforts suggest a different vision: one where coexistence is managed with care, not cruelty. Similar models in cities like Thiruvananthapuram or Kathmandu have also shown that conflict mitigation, veterinary access, and civic awareness can replace punitive approaches.`,
          `The question, then, is not whether animals should exist in cities, but how we choose to live with them. A truly inclusive smart city cannot be defined only by broadband speed or efficient traffic. It must also be measured by how it treats its most vulnerable beings—human and non-human alike. In this context, urban planners and policy-makers must integrate animal welfare into environmental sustainability, public health, and ethical urbanism frameworks. Humane birth control, access to clean water, and designated shelters are not luxuries; they are signs of a city that recognises compassion as a civic virtue.`,
          `After all, the future of cities does not belong to humans alone. And if our goal is to build cities that are truly intelligent, they must be ones that make room for empathy, interdependence, and coexistence.`,

    abstract:
      "India's labour market is being dramatically reshaped by globalisation and digital technology. This paper analyses the growth of the gig economy—a sector where flexible, task-oriented, short-term employment is made possible through digital intermediaries such as Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company, Upwork, and Fiverr. The acceleration of this economy (projected to expand from 7.7 million workers in 2020-21 to 23.5 million by 2030) highlights its growing relevance in India's overall economic landscape. We discuss how smartphone proliferation, youth population, urbanisation, and changing consumer tastes drive this growth. While gig work has some distinct benefits—flexibility, reduced entry barriers, and business scalability—it carries serious issues as well. They range from inadequate formal labour protections, social security, irregular income, and worker exposure to unemployment fears, which have been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. From a rigorous analysis of legislative initiatives (such as the Code on Social Security 2020) and private sector interventions, this paper identifies continuing gaps in regulation, worker classification, and enforcement. Informed by international and domestic literature, we outline policy reforms, social protection models, skilling strategies, and collective organisation to promote an inclusive and equitable gig economy. Our study shows how India can balance flexibility with dignity, enabling inclusive transitions in the face of digital disruption.",

    intro: [
      "India's labour market is currently experiencing profound changes reflective of the two forces of globalisation and digital innovation. At the heart of this transformation is the gig economy, a changing labour model based on short-term, flexible and task-oriented work. Gig work is a departure from the 9–5 job model, centred on autonomy, independence and on-demand work, often with the help of technology platforms. The word “gig” has its roots in the music industry and originally was used to describe short-term performances, but now can refer to a wide range of work relationships across a number of industries.",
      "Indeed, the spread of what Morozov (2019) refers to as the fourth industrial revolution globally has forced the inculcation of robotics, automation and artificial intelligence into workers’ daily routines (Banwari, 2018). As digital progress has exploded, so too has remote work, app-driven delivery, freelancer markets, and gig work. The gig economy in India has grown fast courtesy, increasing smartphone penetration, urbanisation and a youthful demography (Bekal et al., 2023). According to Boston Consulting Group, the gig economy in India could account for more than $250 billion in annual transactions and up to 90 million jobs in the coming decade (Manjunatha, 2023).",
      "The gig economy now forms an integral part of India’s growth story. Gig economy is not limited to the delivery or transportation sector and could be related to software development, creative content, consulting, design, digital marketing, et.al (Kshatriya & Kurien, 2023). Among the advantages: flexibility, autonomy and lower barriers to entry that appeal to both workers and companies. Gig workers are a cost-efficient and scalable labour pool for companies, particularly startups and SMEs. Labour force (especially Millennials and Gen Z) is more attracted by the work-life balance, experience and autonomy the gig economy brings (Seshadri, 2024).",
      "But for all its promise, the gig economy is not without obstacles. Most of the gig workers are independent contractors with no social security, health insurance or job security. There are no regulations around minimum wages, working conditions, or grievance redressal. This renders gig work precarious, especially with inflation, erratic income, and the absence of institutional credit (Manjunatha, 2023). The vulnerabilities of income disruption, health risks, and job loss were starkly revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic for many gig workers (Kshatriya & Kurien, 2023).",
      "To respond to these concerns, the government has made efforts with reforms such as the Code on Social Security 2020, which aims to extend social security provisions to gig and platform workers. Urban Company and BigBasket are other examples of companies that have adopted proactive policies such as paying minimum wages and offering skills training (Seshadri, 2024). However, effective implementation is still elusive due to definitional ambiguities and the absence of strong enforcement frameworks. Thus India’s gig economy epitomises both opportunity alongside inequality. It seeks stronger labour protections while widening pathways for employment in self-employment amidst a digitally transformative backdrop. Undoubtedly, the gig economy will be pivotal in driving India towards its $5 trillion aspiration, but only if guided by sustainable transitions rooted in equity along with robust regulatory frameworks.",

        paragraphs: [
          "The rise of new technologies and shifting customer expectations have pushed businesses to rethink how they operate. To stay ahead in today’s fast-paced environment, many companies are reinventing their business models. As part of this shift, a new term, the ‘Gig Economy’, has arisen, a slang term for a job where workers are paid on a per-performance basis (Zwick et al., 2018).",
          "The growing demand for the growth of the gig economy was primarily stimulated by cost-saving pressures in response to the global financial crisis in 2008, which instigated demand for temporary and contract-based workers (Cunningham et al., 2016; Glynn TP et al., 2018). Collins et. al. find that almost all the growth in the gig workforce since 2011 was in online platform work (Collins et al., 2019). Market platforms, such as the capital platform Airbnb and the labour platforms Upwork, Uber, Zomato, etc., offer several advantages (Farrell, Greig et al. There is now more than ever a demand for working remotely at home in the world of COVID-19! A study by the National Bureau of Economics shows that in 2020, almost 2.1 million new workers entered the gig economy, double the number of entrants in 2019 (S.Li, 2023; NBER, 2023).",
          "Young adults aged 18–29 are most common in the economy (Aleksandric, M., 2023), and approximately 30% of them work on gig platforms for money (Aleksandric, M., 2023). Jobs in the form of gig work are popular not only in Nigeria but in other parts of the world for corporate strategies and performance management in IT-enabled services, e-commerce, hotel, retail, FMCG among others, mostly for short-term engagements at the lateral levels: (Schmenner, Swink, 1998; AfDB et al., 2018). In the Indian economy itself, the gig economy started to evolve from around the early 2000s, and a number of catalysts, including employer preference, demographic shifts in the mass of workers, and technological innovation, were behind this development. Due to this, the traditional 9-5 model of employment began to be broken down by promoting a more flexible, agile style of work (Wood AJ et al., 2019).",
          "The gig economy sees the efficient use of resources and puts into play the element of which workers’ skills are best used in which task. This, in turn, helps individuals and businesses to run more smoothly and also sees to it that talent is put to full use, which in turn boosts overall productivity, and we see that play out in greater economic growth. Also, to that point, the gig economy does very well in what it does in countries like India, which is seeing a growth in the job-seeking population which outpaces that of traditional job growth. It puts forth options for which people may have a hard time getting into stable, long-term employment for a number of reasons, which include age barriers, family responsibilities, or a lack of formal education (Kasliwal, 2020). Also, in the case of the gig economy, we see that it puts forth greater value to society, which in turn improves urban living and sustainability. For instance, we have seen a reduction in motor vehicle accidents, in traffic jam levels and improvement in air quality (Greenwood, Wattal, 2017; Tran, Sokas, 2017). Also, these are the issues which put the gig economy in a positive light.",
          "But also, the gig economy has its downsides. In India, which has limited social safety nets and where many gig workers are from low financial backgrounds, we see that the lack of stable income and job security only serves to worsen the present hard times. Also, as reported by L. Snider, companies are able to reduce cost per employee by 20-30% by getting away from paying for things like overtime, vacation, social security, Medicare and monetary workplace injury compensation (Snider et al., 2018). Companies also term these employees as ‘delivery partners’ to get around any responsibility. As a large number of which do not fit into traditional employee categories we see that gig workers’ access to what are considered basic benefits is a issue health care, set work times, stable contracts, and which which which also have access to processes in place for when issues arise. Also, to this point, the constant search for the next gig, which is a part of the gig economy, puts a lot of pressure on workers, which in turn causes stress and burnout. In the platform economy, we see that each task is a performance opportunity or a penalty, which in turn leaves no time for rest and puts workers in a constant state of control. Also, we see that in the platform economy, tech advances like AI are used to put workers in touch with the right clients, which in turn leads to better task matching, greater job satisfaction, and income growth, but also has the issue of leaving no room for rest.",
          "Some reports also claim that the gig economy causes economic disparity and gender inequality in economic terms (Wood AJ et al., 2019; Churchill B, 2021). The World Bank reported that among 435 million global gig workers, many, especially in developing countries, have no job protections or savings, making them vulnerable to exploitation (World Bank, 2023). A study of over 20,000 freelancers found that women typically earn around 30% less per hour than men (Kuhn et al., 2017).",
          "A very big reason for such disparities is that the gig workers are not specifically covered by any of India's current labour laws, including the Employees' Provident Fund Act, the Payment of Wages Act, and the Industrial Disputes Act. Because of this, gig workers are missing out on fundamental labour rights. The Code on Social Security, 2020, provides some measures to explain gig workers' issues and work towards social security funds for gig workers. Although the Code on Social Security, 2020, makes promises to extend some benefits, the exercise of its provisions, along with enforcement, remains variable and lacking. Gig workers also have limited ability to organise or form unions because they are excluded from the labour rules that protect the right to collective bargaining (Nadagoudar et al., 2021). As such, there is a need to digest labour laws and separate out a category for gig workers with a limited set of labour rights (Harris SD, 2017; Cherry MA et al., 2016; Prassl J et al., 2017). According to the Observer Research Foundation, a paper highlights important aspects that regulatory interventions could address—protection against workplace harassment, an emergency button for physical safety, social security, and contract security protection (Kasliwal, 2020). While these proposals are reasonable, there exists a gap in addressing certain ethical dilemmas. First, the lack of detailed data on the number of workers and composition of India's gig workforce is a significant gap. Secondly, sizable uncertainty remains regarding the socioeconomic impact of gig employment. Further study, moreover, is required to ascertain the impact of the new gig economy on traditional labour markets. There is a strong demand for this research to sail past its methodological gaps. This constitutes a layered approach recognising the various dimensions of safeguarding the rights and welfare of gig workers. In this regard, the gig economy should be not only flexible labour but also attempts to provide labour that is both flexible as well as ethically acceptable, such that the new space of gig work contributes to every stakeholder's benefit, particularly the workers at the heart of it.",

        paragraphs: [
          "India's integration into the rest of the world through technology and the internet has had quite an impact on the rapid development of the gig economy. The evolution of mobile technology and platforms offering services have changed how people interact economically, permitting new forms for work throughout employment globalization accompanied by a shift toward digital interfacing. Services such as Swiggy, Ola, Uber, Flipkart, and Urban Company have created a new digitally mediated-serviced economy that enables millions to take part in short-term contracts or independent gigs (Banwari, 2018).This change has been aided by various demographic factors. The population’s younger age structure along with ongoing urbanization as well as high smartphone penetration created a pool of digitally-educated young job seekers. In light of few available secure salaried positions coupled with costly living standards, freelance work is highly attractive. Platforms offer opportunities via Freelancer.com, Fiverr or Upwork allows far greater reach which boosts income from foreign exchange as well international exports of services (Seshadri 2024).",
          "As per the data released Online Labour Index, India ranks top within countries supplied online freelance labour globally. Approximate 45% share in Online Indian Gig Work participation comes from Software Development & Technology Services (Banwari 2018). The increased confidence in e-commerce and the surge in app-based services have broadened avenues of work access, easing geographic, qualification, and formal training limitations (Bekal et al., 2023).",
          "Globalization has its benefits, but they are not equally shared. Residents living in urban areas with readily available internet connectivity and modern technological devices stand at an advantage to access gig work, while residents from rural areas remain largely marginalized. Not to mention the intense competition for available tasks cuts wages further perpetuating long-term income instability (Manjunatha, 2023). Additionally, this type of globalized gig work deepens skill mismatches–where overqualified individuals engage in menial work unaligned with their education (Seshadri, 2024).",
          "Still, the potential of the gig economy as a driver towards inclusive employment is significant. With proper digital infrastructure coupled with targeted skilling initiatives and strong policy frameworks, globalization can be used constructively toward expanding gig work inclusively. Protective policies should also be implemented to guarantee adequate compensation, pay disputes, worker classification safeguards, and nullify contractor misclassification schemes ensuring balance between growth and equity within this changing framework of employment.",

        paragraphs: [
          "Consumerism is a socioeconomic way of thinking that assumes that the more goods purchased (and services consumed), the better the economy is. It also constitutes a factor which, in modern post-industrial societies, not only informs market behaviors, but also attitudes, values, identity, and the structure of various institutions. Coupled with the increase in consumer culture, the last two decades have seen the emergence ofthe  gig economy—an agile human-worker based on a digital network which links people to a plethora of short-term and casual work opportunities. These changes have greatly contributed to ongoing debates concerning precarious employment opportunities and the reduction of stable jobs (Joshi et al., 2024; Woodcock, 2021).",
          "Raw gig work is characterized as informal and divided, nontraditional (Sterrantino & Salerno, 2021). Uber, DoorDash, Airbnb, and Fiverr are examples of flexible employment that digitally connect their users. Flexible Work Environments have been discussed by Huang et al in 2020. While for some it is a supplementary source of income, for a substantial part it serves as the primary source of income (Friedland & Balkan, 2022). This situation typically generates financial instability and causes employees to assume very pragmatic and risk-averse consumption behaviours (Zietlow, 2020).",
          "Gig platforms collect mountains of consumer data, studying preferences, behavior, and use, and tailoring services and targeted advertising accordingly. This continual bombardment of personalized advertising not only promotes on-platform traction but also stimulates impulsive purchasing and a positive feedback loop of need and satisfaction.",

          "Gig platforms which have integrated into the fabric of our daily lives are those which allow for the outsourcing of a great range of tasks from cooking and cleaning to running errands and doing repairs.

But instead of using it for sleep or fun, this time it is often recycled into more of the same consumer behavior.",

          "1.4. Cheap Tricks and The Real Cost of Convenience",
          "Gig companies frequently sidestep traditional labour costs by categorizing workers as independent contractors, a move that enables them to undercut prices. This brings services that used to be the luxury resort of the few — like a chauffeur ride, a restaurant-quality meal delivered at home — into the mainstream. Though it appeals to consumers, these low prices are all too often the product of undercutting worker protections and fair wages, and have made normal something that places affordability before equity.",

These tendencies are reinforced through advertising, whose message links effortlessness to accomplishment, consumption to identity.",

This can be attributed in part to the gig work culture, which gives workers the flexibility and independence (Ray,2024). Gig, or freelance, workers can choose their own hours and places of work, allowing the involvement of women and rural communities in India’s economy to upshift considerably (Gaur & Sharma,2023). This enables women and other employees to generate incomes from multiple sources while balancing work and life (Gaur & Sharma,2023). These gig platforms offer women the flexibility to balance their personal and professional responsibilities, thus promoting financial independence(Sharma & Gaurav,2023). Now they can spend as per their requirement in a more empowered manner, which will lead to empowerment of women and effective use of India’s demographic dividend.",
          "The gig economy is utilising India’s demographic dividend too, as it hires under- and semi- educated on the basis of their skills rather than their education (Gaur & Sharma,2023). Several ed-tech platforms, including UpGrad and Simplilearn, are seeing rising demand for courses in these skills. Government programs such as Digital India have boosted the growth of the gig economy through better telecommunication infrastructure and internet accessibility (Gaur & Sharma,2023). They now have the Internet and/or smartphones in their hands, even in the hinterland, and they can participate in the digital economy. So, people living in the village can decrease the migration to cities based on work and finding something to do, and it’s all fine for them to be able to do everything remotely (Sharma & Gaurav,2023).",
          " Newer players like Ola, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato have merged unmet service patterns to freelancers who are available to fulfill those meet (Ray,2024). These businesses, which are nascent companies, are highly dependent on gig workers for delivery and ridesharing. Startups generally have a lean operation, and they have a need for skilled manpower at lower costs (Gaur & Sharma,2023). While gig workers might not be highly educated, they are upskilled by ed tech companies or by the platforms themselves. This process is good for startups because it cuts the cost of business (Gaur & Sharma,2023) and it also creates more jobs. India Non IIM MBA Jobs A report by the World Bank in the year 2018 (as cited in Gaur & Sharma,2023) was a revelation in itself. India needs to add 8 million new jobs every year to keep the employment figure going, with about 1.3 million individuals becoming jobless every month. The gig economy goes some way toward solving this by offering more than 15 million jobs in India (Gaur & Sharma,2023). There is a growing engagement of gig workers in other functions such as human resources, customer service, operations, marketing, sales, software engineering, graphic designing (Gaur & Sharma,2023), and even manual labour, many of which do not require formal qualifications (Gaur & Sharma,2023). The growth of the gig economy has seen development in infrastructure, technology, and logistics.

          "Although the economy will have grown to value of $335 billion (Gaur & Sharma,2023) and also generate 350 million jobs by 2025 (India Brand Equity Foundation as cited in Gaur & Sharma,2023) . But it is also to address some of the problems such as high precarity (Ray,2024) i.e. Uncertainty, in the payment system, in other words, nobody really knows that whether full payment will go into an account or not, that it will do so in a timely way or not (Gaur & Sharma,2023). We then have an issue in how we will deal if any future crises come ,like COVID-19, which is very likely to see platforms and state reassemble who will leave vulnerable individuals ,like they did in COVID -19 (Ray,2024) to fall back on families in villages ,Whatsapp groups and other parallel socio  “spatial networks” (Ray,2024) helped grant access to concessional medicines and other resources during the pandemic (Ray,2024). But for the labour  not having any solid support system in their villages, this was not of any help to them (Ray,2024). This triggered a spike in transportation cost as demand spiked. And a study conducted last year by Flourish Venture found that 90% of ride-share drivers and 75% of delivery riders experienced a marked decline in earnings (Ray,2024). ",
          "The digitization of the informal sector on these platforms has not at all altered the cultural and social attitudes or the socialist view of the worker as diseased and poor (Ray,2024) and the state of the workers’ labour follows suit in an unbroken continuity of brutality as what they used to suffer remains their continuing lot in life (Ray,2024). Digitalization of the informal economy on these platforms in no way altered the cultural and social attitude or socialist perspectives about such workers so they are perceived as diseased and poor rendering them immediately facing no less adversity than they experienced before (Ray,2024). ",
          "Gig workers are classified as independent contractors and not as workers which means they do not have the benefits that formal employees have insurance, provident fund, and protection under labour laws (Suvarnapathaki et al.2025). The law is thus not on their side, the Code of Social Security 2020 may have put them in the worker category which was a step forward for their cause but that legislation has yet to be put into practice (Suvarnapathaki et al.2025).Even the Code of Social Security does not mention that they will get insurance, provident fund or paid leave and the law does not mandate companies to provide it (Suvarnapathaki et al.2025), which leaves these labourers without any voice in the company (Sharma & Gaurav,2023). ",
          " Two interesting insights were obtained through a review of 14 couriers in Hyderabad (Govindharaj,2024). The first is the general classification of waiting time, which consists of standing time for order pickup in the restaurant’s line and intra-order between end of one and assigning other and outside residential hubs customer waiting time. From the employees point of view, if you simply add all four of these types of waiting together it is estimated they represent about 25 to 30% of the their recorded hours (Govindharaj,2024) .The other issue was working with mobile apps and it was leading to tedious workflows of clicking confirm buttons for deliveries, calling customers for directional guidance, taking pictures for proof including within the Swiggy application and Google Maps leading to mental tiredness and burnout (Govindharaj,2024).",

          "While at present we have see initiatives like the Code on Social Security (2020) and Rajasthan’s ground breaking state level legislation which have set in motion a regulatory trend, in many areas we still see large gaps in protection, classification and enforcement. India has taken initial action to put gig and platform work into separate labour categories. The Code on Social Security (2020) is a base element which includes “gig workers” and “platform workers” in social welfare programs. The Code which also serves as a foundation puts in place life insurance, health benefits and pension security which the central government is to design via contributions from the government, platform companies and the workers itself (Code on Social Security, 2020). Alongside this, the Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act of 2023 was India’s first legislative effort at state-level governance for gig work. It provided for the establishment of a welfare board, a grievance mechanism, and data-sharing requirements—creating important groundwork for federal action (Rajasthan Bill 2023). ",

          "-	Counterargument: Platform Work Offers Flexibility and Agency",
          "People who argue against regulation of the gig economy typically point out that platforms offer flexibility and autonomy to workers, particularly women and students, who like part-time or freelance options. Excessive regulation, they contend, would hamper the very things that make jobs under such platforms attractive to individuals.",

          "Whereas globalisation has created new opportunities for gig work (such as online freelancing), it has also raised labour market competition and undermined employment security for most informal workers.

    conclusion: [
      "The gig economy adds value to business-as-usual brick and mortar, it helps to open up new markets and access spaces they were never able to reach before. A comprehensive dive into the world of the gig economy, showing how it has become the essential lifestyle for workers, consumers, and businesses across the globe._taboola. However, along with the flexibility, job creation and economic empowerment, the research highlights some vital challenges and ethical issues which suggest the need for cautions. The gig workers are fabric in the existing law under which the protection is still not complete and hence,they are increasingly becoming exploitation closer and exploitation. The proliferation of the gig economy is fuelled by technological progression and so it becomes imperative to keep a step ahead to meet these challenges.",
      "The study highlights the need for thoughtful and tailored solutions, such as introducing specific labour laws or creating new categories for gig workers, that adjust to meet the protection of gig workers' fundamental rights and guarantee equitable treatment. Ethical issues are also very important, with discrimination, especially as it pertains to race and gender, becoming a dominant concern in the gig economy. Thus, the framework should aim to protect social benefits and post-retirement entitlements while ensuring appropriate compensation for services rendered, maintaining a careful balance between flexibility in work hours. There is an alarming lack of oversight offered through regulation that establishes basic legal standards for working conditions across different industries. As such there is an immediate void that needs to be addressed. This model calls upon policymakers to proactively shape shipping into respectable real work rather than leftover tasks provided by businesses of shifting models devoid of meaning confined to screens.",
      "In conclusion, the concerns raised by Byung-Chul Han about self-exploitation, along with insights from SME Futures highlighting the harsh realities behind the promise of 'being your own boss,' seem to reflect the growing challenges faced by gig workers today. While the gig economy offers flexibility and independence, it often comes with instability, a lack of protections, and increased pressure to constantly perform. India has the potential to build a gig economy that is fair, sustainable, and aligned with long-term economic growth by implementing targeted regulatory reforms and fostering collaboration among all stakeholders. These issues highlight the need for further research to create a more secure future for the gig workers in India.",

      "Understanding cognitive impairments within major brain disorders is central to neuropsychology and clinical psychology. This paper explores Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Specific Learning Disorders (SLD), and through cognitive and neural perspectives. PTSD’s characteristic hypervigilance and memory intrusions are explained by models emphasizing elaborated fear networks and attentional biases (Hayes et al., 2012). Alzheimer’s disease reflects hippocampal and DMN disconnection, leading to memory and executive dysfunction (Mevel et al., 2011). Developmental dyslexia, as a representative SLD, is underpinned by phonological deficits and dysfunction in reading circuits (Menghini et al., 2010). By comparing distinct neuropsychological profiles and their shared features such as deficits in memory, executive function, and processing speed. This paper underscores the significance of brain-behavior relationships. The analysis emphasizes how cognitive impairments in these disorders correspond to disruptions in large-scale brain networks, guiding both diagnostic approaches and targeted interventions within clinical practice.",

      "Neuropsychology offers critical insights into the relationship between brain function and cognitive behavior, particularly in the context of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Each condition discussed in this paper: PTSD, Alzheimer’s disease, and specific learning disorders, presents distinct cognitive profiles grounded in theoretical models of brain dysfunction. These models posit that disruptions in information-processing systems and large-scale neural networks give rise to characteristic cognitive impairments and psychological symptoms (Schaefer et al., 2023).",
      "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is often conceptualized within cognitive frameworks that highlight an elaborated fear network. Traumatic experiences lead to heightened salience of threat-related stimuli, attentional biases, and impaired regulation of emotional responses. This is underpinned by hyperactivity within the amygdala and reduced prefrontal control, reflected in disrupted connectivity between the salience, executive, and default-mode networks (Hayes et al., 2012; Akiki et al., 2017).",
      "Alzheimer’s disease is marked by progressive cognitive decline, particularly affecting episodic memory, executive functions, and visuospatial skills. Theoretical models emphasize the degeneration of hippocampal and cortical networks, especially within the DMN, contributing to impaired memory encoding and retrieval (Mevel et al., 2011). Hippocampal atrophy and posterior cingulate dysfunction are early pathological markers, explaining the hallmark amnestic syndrome of Alzheimer’s disease.",
      "Specific learning disorders, particularly developmental dyslexia, reflect specific deficits in academic skills despite adequate intelligence and educational opportunities. The phonological deficit hypothesis remains a leading explanatory model, proposing that impairments in phonological awareness disrupt reading acquisition. Neuroimaging studies consistently reveal under activation in the left temporoparietal and occipitotemporal regions critical for reading, alongside reduced connectivity among language and visual networks (Menghini et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2022).",
      "Common cognitive themes emerge across these disorders. Executive dysfunction and attentional control impairments are shared features in PTSD, and SLDs (Hayes et al., 2012; Padmanabhan et al., 2017; McCutcheon et al., 2023). Memory disturbances vary: PTSD features biased trauma memory processing, Alzheimer’s disease presents with profound episodic memory loss, and schizophrenia involves deficits in working and verbal memory (Mevel et al., 2011; McCutcheon et al., 2023).",
      "Neuroimaging findings have further illuminated how these cognitive patterns correspond to disruptions in major brain networks. The DMN is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, and PTSD, each showing disorder-specific connectivity alterations (Mevel et al., 2011; Padmanabhan et al., 2017; Kong et al., 2022). The salience network shows hyperactivity in PTSD (Akiki et al., 2017; Kong et al., 2022). Executive networks display reduced connectivity across PTSD, contributing to impaired cognitive control and flexibility (Hayes et al., 2012; McCutcheon et al., 2023). Language and visual networks, particularly in the left hemisphere, are consistently underactive in dyslexia, aligning with phonological processing deficits (Menghini et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2022).",
      "Clinically, understanding these cognitive and neural profiles enhances diagnostic precision and informs intervention strategies. Neuropsychological assessments targeting disorder-specific domains, such as memory in Alzheimer’s, or phonological skills in dyslexia, enable more accurate identification and tailored treatment. Interventions grounded in neuropsychological insights, including trauma-focused cognitive therapy, cognitive remediation, social skills training, and specialized educational programs, address the core deficits highlighted by research. These approaches exemplify how theory-driven neuropsychological models guide both clinical understanding and practical application in managing complex brain disorders.",

          "PTSD is a mental disorder developed due to exposure to a traumatic life experience and is characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance, intense emotions, etc. According to ICD- 11 (World Health Organization, 2022), Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat, for example as indicated by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises.

          "PTSD is a disorder that is triggered by experiencing traumatic life events such as war, witnessing death, natural disasters, car accidents, abuse, sexual assault, etc. After experiencing these types of events, people usually experience anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks, intense negative emotions, intrusive thoughts, etc., when these symptoms last for more than a month and starts hindering with daily life functioning, then the person is said to be suffering from PTSD. The aetiology of PTSD is far more complexed and multifactorial than is shown on the surface. According to Neumeister et al., 2015, there is very minimal research present on aetiology or pathophysiology of PTSD. Williams et al. in 2024 researched that biological factors including dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, brain structural alterations, and physiological markers such as heart rate play a complex role in the development of PTSD. It is not necessary that everyone experiencing a traumatic life experience would develop PTSD. It is affected by various biological, psychological and environmental factors.",

        heading: "NEUROPSYCHOLOGY BEHIND PTSD",
        paragraphs: [
          "Neuropsychology focuses on the biological aspect of Trauma and PTSD. It involves how trauma affects the structure and function of the brain affecting the cognition, emotion, and behaviour. Brain structures such as amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex get effected by PTSD. Research on individuals experiencing trauma shows reduced volume of prefrontal cortex and its lesser structural connectivity to subcortical regions such as amygdala and hippocampus (Kredlow et al., 2021). This lesser connectivity between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex leads to worse stress responses in the individual experiencing trauma. According to Haris et al., (2023), studies reported altered connectivity between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the individuals suffering from PTSD, although the intensity varies on the basis of sex and trauma. Women show stronger amygdala connectivity supporting the fact that PTSD rates are higher among women. According to a study examining the age-related differences in youth with PTSD, it found that unlike youth with PTSD, paediatric PTSD patients did not showed hyperactivity in amygdala showing different neural mechanism in children (Wolf & Herringa, 2015). Akiki et al. in 2017 observed localised shape abnormalities in the anterior hippocampus and dorsal amygdala of the individuals with PTSD linked to PTSD severity and dysfunction in emotional regulation and context processing. PTSD along with emotional and behavioural symptoms also causes cognitive impairment disrupting the cognitive functioning of the individual. According to research by Quinones et al. in 2020, it is found that PTSD is strongly linked with cognitive dysfunction particularly in memory, attention, processing speed, and executive function. This cognitive dysregulation can either be an after effect of PTSD or a risk factor making individuals prone to PTSD.",
          "Thus, Neuropsychology behind PTSD (Post- traumatic stress disorder) is a topic that needs extensive research covering the research gap and providing a basic structure of the treatment plans for the disorder. Future research about the biological parameters can help in designing early intervention plans focused on biological and cognitive findings, aiding to more personalised and effective treatment plans for individuals living with PTSD.",

This slow decline often brings up the painful question: What’s happening to them? The usual response we hear is, “They have Alzheimer’s disease.” But how many of us really grasp what that entails beyond just memory loss? Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects older adults (Zeliger, 2023). It’s marked by a gradual decline in cognitive functions, memory, language abilities, and behavior. Unlike some illnesses that can be diagnosed with a simple test, Alzheimer’s requires a more nuanced approach due to its intricate and changing nature. Diagnosis often involves a process of elimination—ruling out other possible causes of cognitive decline, like strokes, brain tumors, or vitamin deficiencies (Bronstein & Pulst, 2003). This complexity adds to the emotional and medical hurdles faced by both those living with the disease and their caregivers.",

          "Alzheimer’s disease got its name from Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German neurologist who first brought attention to the condition back in the early 20th century. In 1901, a 51-year-old woman named Auguste Deter was admitted to a hospital in Frankfurt, where Dr. Alzheimer was her physician. She showed some pretty unusual symptoms for someone her age, including severe memory loss, trouble with language, paranoia, and a tendency to withdraw socially. Sadly, her health declined quickly, and she passed away in 1906. During the autopsy, Dr. Alzheimer noticed significant shrinkage in the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that handles complex functions like memory, reasoning, speech, and decision-making. He also found abnormal clumps, which we now call amyloid plaques, and tangled fibers known as neurofibrillary tangles in her brain. These groundbreaking discoveries set the stage for what we now recognize as Alzheimer’s disease.",

        paragraphs: [
          "The symptoms of Alzheimer’s can differ quite a bit from one person to another, but they usually follow a fairly predictable progression. In the early stages, people may notice short-term memory issues, like forgetting recent chats, misplacing things, or having trouble remembering appointments (Manivasagam et al., 2023). As the disease progresses, these symptoms tend to get worse, leading to feelings of disorientation, confusion, and difficulty recognizing familiar faces or places. Over time, even long-term memories can start to slip away. On a biological level, Alzheimer’s is marked by two key pathological features: the buildup of amyloid-beta plaques outside neurons and the development of tau tangles inside them (Shaikh & Shinde, 2024). These issues disrupt the brain’s communication pathways, ultimately causing neurons to die and brain tissue to shrink. Alongside cognitive decline, patients often experience behavioral and psychological symptoms. They may become easily agitated, withdrawn, anxious, or depressed. In the later stages, they might lose the ability to speak, walk, or eat on their own, necessitating constant care and support (Manivasagam et al., 2023).",

        paragraphs: [
          "Diagnosing Alzheimer’s can be quite a challenge due to its gradual onset and the variety of symptoms it presents. The journey usually starts with a clinical evaluation, where doctors take a deep dive into the patient’s medical and family history, along with their current symptoms. They perform physical and neurological exams to assess reflexes, coordination, and muscle tone (Tato & Perneczky, 2022). To evaluate cognitive function, doctors often turn to standardized tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). These assessments focus on memory, attention, problem-solving, and language skills, helping to gauge the level of cognitive decline, particularly in episodic memory, which is a key indicator of early-stage Alzheimer’s (Flier, 2018).",
          "Beyond cognitive tests, healthcare professionals also utilize neuroimaging techniques to spot changes in brain structure and function. MRI scans can show brain atrophy, particularly in the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in memory formation. Meanwhile, PET scans can identify abnormal accumulations of amyloid plaques or shifts in glucose metabolism that are linked to neuronal dysfunction (Sodha et al., 2024; Flier, 2018). Additionally, analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture can reveal unusual levels of amyloid-beta and tau proteins, which serve as biochemical markers for Alzheimer’s (Sodha et al., 2024). These diagnostic methods are invaluable for confirming the disease and differentiating it from other types of dementia, such as vascular dementia or Lewy body dementia.",

One significant breakthrough is the development of blood-based biomarkers that can identify elevated levels of tau or amyloid proteins in the bloodstream. This offers a less invasive and more scalable way to catch Alzheimer’s disease early. On top of that, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques, like Gradient Boost algorithms, are being employed to sift through large datasets—including genetic information, imaging results, and clinical symptoms—to predict Alzheimer’s with greater accuracy (Ergen & Sertkaya, 2022).

Support systems, including therapy, support groups, and respite care, are essential for helping caregivers navigate this demanding role.

This paper highlighted how disorders like PTSD,  Alzheimer’s disease, and learning disabilities each present unique cognitive impairments rooted in specific neural dysfunctions. Despite their differences, a common thread runs through them: disruptions in key brain networks—particularly those governing memory, executive functioning, and emotional regulation. Neuroimaging and neurocognitive research have made these invisible disruptions visible, offering critical insights into diagnosis, intervention, and treatment.",
      "Importantly, this neuropsychological understanding reminds us that these conditions are not merely labels—they are lived experiences shaped by complex interactions between the brain, environment, and individual development. As our scientific tools grow more precise, so too should our clinical and educational responses. The goal is no longer just to identify what is 'wrong' in the brain, but to use that knowledge to guide compassionate, personalized care. Whether it's creating targeted cognitive therapies for PTSD, building inclusive classrooms for students with dyslexia, or supporting families affected by Alzheimer’s, neuropsychology empowers us to treat not just symptoms, but the whole person. In doing so, we move closer to a future where brain-based differences are met with understanding, support, and dignity.",

    title: "RECONCILING DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGY: A REGIONAL ANALYSIS OF SDG 15 IMPLEMENTATION IN INDIA",
    author: "Maithreyi Govindula and Stooti Horo",
    authorAbbrev: "Maithreyi Govindula and Stooti Horo",
    abstract: "The essay examines the clash between ecological sustainability and economic development in India through a regional perspective, using the case of application of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land). Based on two meticulous case studies illegal coal mining in Chhattisgarh's Hasdeo Aranya forest and unplanned urbanization in Hyderabad. The research subjectively analyses the socio-environmental implications of development processes that overlook ecological interest and disenfranchise native populations. It identifies chronic governance lapses, poor enforcement of environmental policies, and structural exclusion of indigenous perspectives in land-use planning. Far from India's official pledge to SDG 15, the results unveil profound structural disconnects between policy discourse and on-ground realities. The article demands a rights-based, inclusive environmental governance framework that incorporates local wisdom, emphasizes ecological durability, and confronts the trade-offs between short-term development and long-term resilience. Ultimately, it champions alternate paths of development based on transparency, inclusivity, and environmental justice.",

    intro: [
      "India’s recent economic transformation over the past three decades has been characterised by extensive infrastructural growth, industrialisation, and urbanisation. While these developments have driven increases in income, employment, and access, they have also placed unprecedented pressure on the nation’s environmental systems. The pursuit of development, often framed in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and international competitiveness, has frequently come into conflict with environmental sustainability, particularly concerning land use and natural resource management. This tension is most evident in sectors such as mining, urban expansion, and disaster management, where environmental considerations are repeatedly sidelined in favour of commercial and administrative priorities.",
      "This paper examines two paradigmatic case studies that illustrate the complex relationship between India’s development trajectory and environmental degradation. The first is illegal mining in Chhattisgarh, where extractive industries have encroached upon forest and tribal lands, often bypassing environmental regulations and local consent (Tripathy, 2024). The second case is urban sprawl in Hyderabad, where real estate speculation and infrastructure development have driven rapid city expansion, leading to the significant loss of green cover, water bodies, and biodiversity, with serious implications for urban climate resilience and environmental justice (Jha et al., 2021).",
      "These case studies are analysed in relation to Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15): Life on Land, which calls for the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite India’s formal commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the realities on the ground reveal a persistent gap between policy rhetoric and implementation. This disconnect is further exacerbated by weak institutional accountability, fragmented governance structures, and the systematic exclusion of local and indigenous communities from environmental decision-making processes.",
      "The structure of this article is as follows. Section 2 presents the background and literature review, situating the case studies within the wider context of land acquisition, mining, and urbanisation in India, and discusses India’s take on SDG15 targets. Section 3 briefly explains how this study contributes to the broader debate. Sections 4 and 5 provide detailed examinations of the Chhattisgarh and Hyderabad case studies, respectively. Section 6 offers a comparative analysis of the two cases, identifies recurring governance patterns, and discusses alternative development models. The final section presents the conclusion, summarising key findings, outlining policy recommendations, and proposing directions for future research and community-led conservation initiatives.",
      "By engaging with these grounded case studies, this article aims to make a constructive contribution to the ongoing debates on sustainable development in India and more broadly, underscoring the urgent need for more ecologically sensitive and socially inclusive approaches to development."

        paragraphs: [
          "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the 17 global objectives established by the United Nations in 2015, to be achieved by 2030 as part of its Sustainable Development (SD) programme (Tisdell, 2020). This study focuses specifically on SDG 15: Life on Land, to critically examine how these goals are being pursued in India.",
          "SDG 15 aims to 'protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss' (Klein, 2020, p.1). ",
          "As a signatory to the UN’s SD agenda, India has committed to fulfilling selected targets, including setting specific quantitative performance objectives for three of the twelve SDG 15 targets by 2030 (Tisdell, 2020).",
          "However, the cases of illegal mining in Chhattisgarh and urban sprawl in Hyderabad reveal the significant challenges these goals face on the ground. India has been experiencing rapid urbanisation and growing resource extraction activities in recent years. In areas such as Chhattisgarh, illegal mining has led to extensive deforestation, the displacement of indigenous communities, and damage to local ecosystems (Ghosh, 2022; Tripathy, 2024). These mining operations often proceed without appropriate legal and environmental clearances, violating both national environmental regulations and the rights of Adivasi (indigenous) communities, forcing them into cycles of displacement and deprivation (Ghosh, 2022). Such activities directly undermine India’s progress towards achieving SDG 15, which calls for the protection and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.",
          "Simultaneously, in rapidly expanding urban centres like Hyderabad, large-scale land-use changes driven by infrastructure development, real estate expansion, and technology corridors have significantly reduced urban green spaces and wetlands (Jha et al., 2021; Ramachandra et al., 2020). The city’s green cover has declined sharply, while the loss of water bodies has exacerbated flooding and intensified the urban heat island effect. The 2025 Kanche Gachibowli forest clearance incident and the subsequent enforcement actions by the Hyderabad Disaster Response & Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) illustrate the governance dilemmas where urban development frequently overrides environmental priorities, often resulting in social displacement and institutional failures in ecosystem protection.",
          "SDG 15 consists of twelve targets that promote international cooperation and emphasise biodiversity conservation, but trade-offs and policy misalignments remain persistent challenges. In India, various government departments handle different aspects of biodiversity and environmental management, often operating independently and following fragmented and poorly coordinated policies (Tisdell, 2020). This fragmentation contributes to policy conflicts and hinders the effective achievement of SDG 15 goals.",
          "India has specifically committed to SDG targets 15.1, 15.2, and 15.7 as part of its contribution to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. However, the cases from Chhattisgarh and Hyderabad reflect a broader national pattern where development-driven environmental degradation is routinely prioritised over sustainability, social justice, and long-term ecological resilience."

        paragraphs: [
          "India has committed to maintaining the proportion of water bodies within its forest areas as part of its SDG 15.1 efforts (Tisdell, 2020). However, mining operations frequently exploit local water sources, leaving minimal access for nearby villages and farmers. The remaining water is often contaminated with toxic chemicals, posing severe risks to aquatic life and the health of local populations (Jha & Jha, 2022). Ghosh (2022) vividly describes the extent of environmental harm, recounting how coal dust settled on fields, polluted water sources, and clung to children as they ran home from school. Furthermore, dam construction for irrigation or industrial purposes without adequate conservation measures has negatively affected wetlands and forests. In Hyderabad, urban expansion has led to the significant loss of green cover, wetlands, and local habitats (Jha et al., 2021; Ramachandra et al., 2020)."

        heading: "Target 15.2: Sustainable Forest Management and Halting Deforestation",
        paragraphs: ["India’s approach to achieving target 15.2 remains vague, with unclear definitions, insufficient transparency, and no explicit national target for the sustainable management of all forest types (Tisdell, 2020). Official records, which have been questioned by the United Nations, report increasing forest cover but fail to differentiate between ecologically rich natural forests, such as Hasdeo, and privately owned monoculture plantations. These are often classified as forests based solely on canopy density and area, without considering ecological integrity (Talukdar, 2022). Replacing ecologically significant forests with monoculture plantations cannot substitute for the biodiversity and cultural value of intact natural forests."]

        paragraphs: [
          "India’s SDG 15.7 target focuses on maintaining wild elephant populations at 2017 levels but neglects the escalating issue of human-elephant conflict. The current plan does not address retaliatory killings of elephants due to crop damage, a critical omission. This is particularly relevant as mining expansion in the Hasdeo Aranya region has worsened human-elephant conflicts, frequently resulting in loss of life and crop destruction (Mukherjee, 2021). Mining also opens up previously inaccessible forests, creating new routes for illegal wildlife trade and poaching (Sayer et al., 2020). Although SDG 15.7 highlights the need to reduce illegal trafficking of elephant products, in India, Asian elephants are more commonly killed due to their perceived threat to agriculture, rather than ivory poaching (Tisdell, 2020).

        paragraphs: [
          "Environmental Degradation through Resource Exploitation",
          "Kumar (2024) situates these conflicts within a political ecology framework, highlighting how local communities, NGOs, social movements, governments, and multinational corporations, backed by military and police power, compete over resources. Kumar critiques the tokenistic inclusion of indigenous voices in energy transitions and land-use policies, noting that industries often claim to represent multiple stakeholders but fail to meaningfully involve local and indigenous communities. The repeated violations of legal protections for tribal lands by Indian state and regional authorities to facilitate coal and hydropower projects reinforce this pattern. Ghosh (2021) documents a 2009 protest in Madhya Pradesh, where 5,000 Adivasis marched against mining approvals secured using fraudulent gram sabha resolutions.",
          "Ghosh (2022) and Tripathy (2024) further document how illegal mining in Chhattisgarh has displaced indigenous communities, degraded forests, and eroded local governance rights. Chhotray’s comparative analysis of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh shows that while both states have substantial indigenous populations and rich mineral resources, Jharkhand’s Adivasis have achieved a stronger political foothold, enabling more public debate and resistance. In contrast, Chhattisgarh’s indigenous communities, lacking sustained political representation and facing greater repression, have experienced more severe marginalisation.",
          "Urbanisation and Governance Failures",
          "Hyderabad’s rapid urbanisation and selective demolition policies reveal deep-seated governance and equity issues that have disproportionately affected marginalised communities while escalating environmental risks. HYDRAA’s demolition campaigns, though aimed at reclaiming public property, have mainly targeted marginal spaces and developer-led encroachments, often displacing those with insecure tenure and limited legal protection (Ramesh & Rao, 2021).",
          "Environmental and Social Implications",
          "Mukherjee (2021) critiques the persistent framing of development as displacement-driven progress, which has historically marginalised vulnerable communities. He argues that existing legal protections, if properly enforced, could prevent the harms currently inflicted on affected populations. In Hyderabad, environmental regulations have often been ignored in favour of rapid commercial development. The 2025 Kanche Gachibowli clearance for an IT park proceeded without adequate adherence to the Forest Conservation Act or Environmental Impact Assessment norms (newindianexpress.com; telanganatoday.com). This environmentally damaging clearance not only triggered public protests but also highlighted the ongoing tensions between development and ecosystem protection. Students and professors joined the resistance, emphasising the land’s crucial role in sustaining local wildlife and water cycles (indianexpress.com)."

        heading: "Contribution to the Broader Debate",
        paragraphs: [
          "This study adds to the broader debate by demonstrating that India’s SDG 15 commitments are consistently undermined by on-ground development practices that prioritise short-term economic growth over environmental and social sustainability. By situating these local struggles within the global sustainability framework, this research highlights a critical disconnect between international sustainability goals and national development trajectories.",
          "The findings emphasise the pressing need for more inclusive, transparent, and coordinated environmental governance that fully integrates the rights of indigenous and marginalised communities and foregrounds ecological sustainability in policy planning and implementation. Through this focused analysis, the study enriches ongoing discussions about how SDG commitments, particularly in developing countries like India, are often compromised by policy trade-offs, institutional fragmentation, and accountability gaps in the face of extractive and urban development pressures."

        paragraphs: [
          "Case Study: Coal mining in Hasdeo Aranya Forest",
          "The Hasdeo Aranya Forest in Chhattisgarh, India, is a critical ecological and cultural zone, home to indigenous communities such as the Gond, Korwa, and Baiga tribes (Verma, 2024). It is an important ecological and cultural area, where indigenous communities rely on the forest’s resources for their daily survival and way of life. The region is rich in mineral resources, particularly coal, which has attracted significant interest from both public and private mining companies. Although the coal mining sector is primarily managed by the public sector company Coal India, the vast coal deposits in this region have increasingly attracted private companies driven by profit (Mukherjee, 2021). The Hasdeo-Arand Coalfield, one of India’s largest, has been central to this interest, with its extensive coal reserves of over five billion tonnes playing a significant role in supporting the economy and energy supply, albeit at considerable environmental and social costs (Verma, 2024).",
          "The push for economic development and energy security has led to extensive coal mining in this area, driven by the Indian government’s strategy to boost domestic coal production and meet its growing energy demands, despite India being the world’s lowest-cost solar power producer its commitment to increasing renewable capacity to 450 gigawatts by 2030 (Talukdar, 2021). With significant declarations regarding the coal mining in June 2020, the government announced the auction of 41 coal blocks, five of which are located within or near the Hasdeo Forest (Chhotray, 2022; Jha & Jha, 2022). This has heightened environmental and social concerns. The expansion of mining activities has resulted in severe deforestation, disruption of wildlife corridors, and contamination of local water sources. Notably, the mining operations in the Parsa East and Kente Basan (PEKB) block began in 2013 under Adani Mining (a subsidiary of the Adani Group) (Ghosh, 2022; Talukdar, 2021). Tribal communities strongly believe that mining corporations have bypassed or manipulated the gram sabha consent process to secure government approvals, which they view as a direct violation of their constitutional rights (Mukherjee, 2021). Projects such as the Kente Extension and Parsa Coal Block are under development and have faced repeated allegations of circumventing gram sabha consent or using fraudulent means to obtain approvals (Talukdar, 2021).",
          "Key Protests and Legal Struggles",
          "Indigenous communities in Hasdeo have consistently protested against these mining projects, arguing that they violate constitutional protections and disrupt their traditional way of life (Tripathy, 2024; Ghosh, 2022). These protests have included long foot marches to the state capital, Raipur, and continuous appeals against the environmental clearances granted for mining (Jha & Jha, 2022). The Hasdeo Aranya Bachao Sangharsh Samiti has been at the forefront of this resistance, advocating for the preservation of the forest and the protection of tribal rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA) (Mukherjee, 2021).",
          "Despite legislative frameworks like the FRA, which mandates that no Scheduled Tribe member or traditional forest dweller can be evicted without proper recognition and verification of their rights, enforcement on the ground has been weak (Verma, 2024; Mukherjee, 2021). The Land Acquisition Act of 2013 aimed to ensure fair compensation and community consultation (Ghosh, 2022; Taldukdar, 2021), but amendments introduced in 2014 diluted these protections, particularly for public-private partnership projects (Mukherjee, 2021). These changes made it easier for the government and corporations to acquire land without securing community consent or conducting thorough social impact assessments (Mukherjee, 2021).",
          "Socio-Economic Impacts",
          "The socio-economic impacts on displaced communities have been severe. Mass displacement has not only uprooted livelihoods but also disrupted the ways in which these communities have preserved their cultural identity over generations, something that holds no monetary equivalent. However even the relocation efforts, job offers, and compensation promised by mining companies are often inadequate or remain unfulfilled (Jha & Jha, 2022). Many tribal families have reported losing their primary sources of livelihood following the acquisition of their land for coal mining (Verma, 2024). The loss of fertile land and forests has forced many to relocate to cities or nearby towns in search of employment. Major towns such as Korba, Bilaspur, and Raipur have attracted economic migrants by offering job opportunities mainly in unorganised sectors like construction and domestic work (Verma, 2024). However, displaced individuals migrating to urban areas frequently face challenges such as discrimination, low wages, and difficulty adjusting to city life (Tripathy, 2024). Research in Chhattisgarh has shown that displacement has disrupted livelihoods, family dynamics, and social network of the families displaced (Verma, 2024). ",
          "Environmental Impacts",
          "Environmental degradation has been another significant consequence. The Hasdeo Aranya Forest spas 170,000 hectares and contains a unique ecosystem, including the proposed Lemru Elephant Reserve (Tripathy, 2024). These destruction of forests has escalated human-elephant conflicts (Mukherjee, 2021), leading to frequent loss of lives and damage to agricultural crops (Ghosh, 2022), as well as reducing access to clean water (Jha & Jha, 2022). Mining operations have depleted and contaminated local water sources. Adani’s PEKB operations in Chhattisgarh have come undere particular scrutiny for environmental violations, especially the release of contaminated water from coal washing activities (Talukdar, 2021). ",
          "Data from independent sources like the Global Forest Watch Dashboard reveal that India continues to lose and convert natural forests for industrial purposes (Talukdar, 2022). Mining in general poses a threat to the environment, but open-cast mining has significantly accelerated environmental degradation. In Jharia, Dhanbad, abandoned underground mines were left unfilled, allowing oxygen to reach burning coal seams and intensify ongoing underground fires (Chhotray, 2022). Together, these activities endanger the region’s biodiversity and erode the Adivasi communities' role as traditional caretakers of the environment (Chhotray, 2022; Talukdar, 2021). ",
          "Community Protests",
          "Protests have taken place by these communities coming together to fight for their rights. While some protests have temporarily halted mining operations, corporations have frequently used legal mechanisms to resume their projects (Jha & Jha, 2022). This region has seen many protests as form of non-violent oppositions against the coal firms. Among the common forms of protest, like the month-long dharnas (sit-ins), padyatras (marches), and fasts, the sit-in beginning in October 2019 against land acquisition for the Parsa coal mine became particularly significant. Hundreds of villagers demonstrated for over three months until it was interrupted by the COVID-19 lockdown the following year, making it the longest ever sit in protest in the region’s history (Talukdar, 2021).",
          "The government’s role as a mediator remains critical, yet its actions have frequently favoured industrial development over the rights and welfare of tribal populations (Chhotray, 2022). In December 2009, around 5,000 Adivasis staged a protest march to the Mines Office in Madhya Pradesh after news broke of a fake gram sabha resolution being submitted to secure mining approvals (Ghosh, 2021 as cited in Kumar, 2024). Despite such resistance, similar patterns continued, as seen in 2011 when Ghatbarra village near the PEKB mine rejected coal mining and filed forest rights claims under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), which prohibits mining clearances until community rights are recognized; nevertheless, the PEKB mine was approved in 2012 and Adani began construction in 2013 (Talukdar, 2021).",
          "Cultural Impacts",
          "The Hasdeo Forest holds deep cultural significance for indigenous communities who have lived there for generations. Their cultural and spiritual practices are deeply intertwined with the forest ecosystem (Verma, 2024). As Ghosh (2022) notes, the community’s resistance is fundamentally tied to the defence of their cultural heritage and their right to continue traditional ways of life without external disruption. Displacement in the region, largely driven by mining in the Hasdeo-Arand Coalfield, has forced many indigenous people to relocate to urban or peri-urban areas, where they struggle to preserve their cultural identities and face pressures to assimilate (Mathew & Kasi, 2021, as cited in Verma, 2024).",
          "Repeated displacement, weakening legal protections, and the continued alignment of state policies with corporate interests have further marginalised these cultural claims (Ghosh, 2022; Mukherjee, 2021). The bypassing of gram sabha consent processes, particularly after the 2014 amendment to the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, is not merely a legal violation but a profound dismissal of the cultural governance systems that these communities depend upon for decision-making and environmental management (Talukdar, 2021). The imposition of development projects without genuine community consultation reflects a systemic disregard for indigenous voices and cultural values."

        paragraphs: [
          "Hyderabad, a fast-growing city and key IT hub, exemplifies the environmental threat posed by uncontrolled urbanisation. The city’s intense land use changes, driven by infrastructure corridors, gated enclaves, and industrial parks, have led to the loss of ecosystem services, increased vulnerability to disasters, and conflicts with biodiversity targets under SDG 15: Life on Land.",
          "Patterns and Processes of Urban Expansion",
          "Urban expansion in Hyderabad, particularly since liberalisation, has been driven by real estate developers and large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Outer Ring Road, IT corridors along Gachibowli-Kondapur, and the planned Pharma City. Farmlands, wetlands, and forest cover have been rapidly urbanised (Jha et al., 2021; Ramachandra et al., 2020).",
          "Remote sensing estimates indicate that the city’s green cover declined from 2.71% in 1991 to 1.66% in 2020 (Jha et al., 2021). Simultaneously, more than half of the water bodies within the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Area (HMDA) have either disappeared or become ecologically degraded due to encroachments (Ramachandra et al., 2020).",
          "Case Study: Kanche Gachibowli Forest Clearing (April, 2025)",
          "In April 2025, the government ordered the clearing of approximately 400 acres near the University of Hyderabad in the Kanche Gachibowli area for the possible development of IT parks. Around 1,524 trees, including 125 protected species, were felled using heavy machinery, raising concerns regarding violations of the Forest Conservation Act and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) norms (newindianexpress.com).",
          "The Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of the matter, ordering an immediate halt to tree felling and requesting an expert assessment by the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) (telanganatoday.com). The CEC found “extensive damage” to the site, including harm to flora, fauna, and hydrological features, and questioned the haste in diverting land without appropriate environmental assessment (newindianexpress.com).",
          "The case sparked protests by university students and professors, who highlighted the environmental importance of the land, its status as a habitat for peacocks, deer, and indigenous plant species, and its role in maintaining local water cycles (indianexpress.com).",
          "Enforcement: Hydra (HYDRAA) crackdowns (2024-2025)",
          "In July 2024, Telangana established HYDRAA, the Hyderabad Disaster Response & Asset Protection Agency, with the mandate to clear encroachments on public properties such as lakes, drains, and parks (en.wikipedia.org). By late 2024, HYDRAA pledged to exempt residential buildings constructed before July 2024 from demolition but to dismantle commercial and encroaching buildings constructed thereafter, particularly around lakes and water bodies (timesofindia.indiatimes.com).",
          "In April 2025, HYDRAA reclaimed 39 acres of government land at Raidurg (Narne Estates) and 39.2 acres in Hafeezpet (Vasantha Homes), removing unauthorised constructions, encroachments on water bodies, and site signboards, despite ongoing Supreme Court litigations (newindianexpress.com).",
          "Environmental and Social Consequences",
          "The large-scale urbanisation and forced demolitions highlight deep-rooted governance and equity challenges. Urban sprawl has intensified Hyderabad’s urban heat island effect, worsened air pollution, and increased flood risks, as clearly demonstrated during the 2020 floods when the filling of lakes and the clogging of stormwater drains caused loss of life and extensive infrastructure damage (Shah, 2020).",
          "HYDRAA’s demolition drives, though intended to reclaim public land, often targeted marginal and developer-built areas; many affected individuals lacked secure tenure or legal support (Ramesh & Rao, 2021). Displacement without adequate rehabilitation remains a persistent issue.",
          "Relevance to SDG15",
          "Hyderabad’s experience highlights the tension between short-term economic growth and environmental sustainability. SDG 15 targets, particularly those related to conserving ecosystems (15.1) and halting biodiversity loss (15.5), are under direct threat from such developments. The Kanche Gachibowli case, in particular, underscores institutional shortcomings in protecting urban ecosystems and enforcing environmental safeguards."

        heading: "4.	ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS",
        paragraphs: [
          "The cases of illegal mining in Chhattisgarh and urban sprawl in Hyderabad reveal significant fault lines in India’s environmental governance. Although they differ by region and sector, mining versus urban infrastructure, both illustrate a development trajectory that consistently sidelines ecological concerns and disempowers local communities. These case studies expose persistent institutional failures and offer valuable insight into the limitations of current sustainability efforts under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15: Life on Land.",
          "Common Patterns and Structural Failures",
          "Across both cases, poor governance emerges as a consistent pattern. In Chhattisgarh, mining operations continue with minimal regulation, often bypassing environmental clearances and violating the Forest Rights Act (FRA), which legally secures forest communities’ rights to their lands. In Hyderabad, state and city-level authorities have facilitated unchecked urban growth through selective land-use amendments, often disregarding Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) protocols and forest protections, as exemplified by the 2025 Kanche Gachibowli deforestation incident.",
          "Another shared theme is the persistent prioritisation of economic development over environmental and social justice. In both instances, government narratives of “progress” and “infrastructure expansion” are employed to justify land acquisition, displacement, and ecological destruction. These narratives serve to legitimise the transfer of public or common lands, often rich in biodiversity and essential to local livelihoods, into the hands of private industrial and real estate developers.",
          "Moreover, both cases highlight the systemic exclusion of local and indigenous communities from planning and governance processes. In Chhattisgarh, Adivasi populations face displacement and criminalisation when they resist illegal mining activities. In Hyderabad, informal settlers and protesters opposing lake encroachments or forest clearance are routinely ignored, or worse, targeted through enforcement bodies such as the Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA). These exclusionary practices result in development outcomes that are both ecologically unsustainable and socially unjust.",
          "Alternative Development Pathways",
          "Despite these failings, opportunities exist to chart alternative development pathways that centre ecological sustainability and democratic participation. In Chhattisgarh, community-led forest governance movements have successfully challenged unauthorised mining, demonstrating the effectiveness of bottom-up conservation strategies aligned with FRA protections and biodiversity goals. Similarly, in Hyderabad, grassroots protests, such as those against the tree felling in Kanche Gachibowli, have prompted judicial intervention and sparked broader public debate on environmental governance.",
          "Realising these alternatives will require robust institutional accountability, strict legal compliance, and participatory decision-making processes. A rights-based approach to land governance, supported by transparent EIA procedures and stringent enforcement against non-compliance, could lead to a more equitable development model. Incorporating ecological data into urban planning, using tools such as geospatial zoning and assessments of ecological carrying capacity, could help safeguard critical ecosystems from irreversible damage.",
          "Global Relevance and SDG Trade-off",
          "The tensions evident in these two Indian cases reflect a broader global challenge: balancing SDG 15 (Life on Land) with overlapping objectives like SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). Across the Global South, infrastructure and extractive projects are frequently prioritised at the expense of biodiversity, climate resilience, and human rights.",
          "These trade-offs underscore the importance of integrated policy responses that do not subordinate ecological considerations. The Indian experience demonstrates that environmental sustainability cannot simply be an add-on to development agendas; it must be embedded within the design, governance, and execution of development initiatives. Anything less risks reducing sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation to little more than aspirational targets."
        ]
      }
    ],
    conclusion: [
      "India’s development trajectory, both in rural mining regions and rapidly expanding urban centres such as Hyderabad, reveals a persistent conflict between economic growth and environmental protection under SDG 15. While India has legal provisions intended to safeguard biodiversity and protect community rights, these laws are frequently bypassed, weakly enforced, or treated as administrative hurdles. Cases like Ghatbarra demonstrate how the consent of indigenous communities is often disregarded, with clearances granted despite legal protections such as the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA). In Hyderabad, the unchecked spread of infrastructure projects, shrinking green cover, and the loss of water bodies have intensified environmental risks, including flooding, urban heat islands, and air pollution. Demolition drives like those carried out by HYDRAA, while aimed at reclaiming public spaces, have also exposed underlying governance issues, particularly the displacement of vulnerable groups without proper rehabilitation. Although India’s legal frameworks offer indigenous and local communities more formal rights compared to countries like Australia, where the Wangan and Jagalingou people face weaker protections, the problem in India lies in the gap between the law and its enforcement (Talukdar, 2021). Activists continue to play a crucial role in bridging this gap by making legal information accessible and supporting communities in navigating complex bureaucracies. Ultimately, India’s ability to meet its SDG 15 targets depends not only on having strong laws, but on ensuring their meaningful enforcement, rebuilding public trust, and placing community voices and ecological sustainability at the centre of development planning."

    abstract: "This research examines the effects of geopolitical pressures on the financial markets in India, emphasizing how international disputes and global conflicts affect key metrics like the stock market, foreign exchange rates, foreign institutional investment (FII) flows, and commodity prices. India, as a developing economy with considerable involvement in global trade and capital movements, is especially vulnerable to geopolitical disturbances like the Israel–Hamas war, the Russia–Ukraine conflict, and increasing U.S.–China tensions. Such incidents frequently create a reluctance to take risks, disturb energy supplies, and incite capital outflow, leading to currency devaluation, fluctuations in the stock market, and inflationary tensions. Through recent case studies and time-series data examination, the study investigates the pathways by which geopolitical uncertainty influences investor behavior and market results. The results indicate that even conflicts occurring far away can create notable short-term disruptions in India's financial system, particularly via increased oil prices and abrupt changes in global liquidity. Moreover, the research emphasizes the function of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in stabilizing the rupee and preserving macroeconomic equilibrium via intervention tactics. This study seeks to enhance the comprehension of how financial markets in emerging economies react to geopolitical risks and offers policy suggestions to strengthen India's economic resilience and market stability amid growing global uncertainty. ",

    intro: [
      "In a more interconnected world, the stability of national financial markets, including India's, is greatly affected by geopolitical factors like military conflicts, trade disagreements, and diplomatic strains. India's swift economic growth and incorporation into international trade render it especially susceptible to external disturbances that may hinder its financial stability. Geopolitical factors appear as worldwide political tensions that foster instability, influencing India's stock exchanges, foreign exchange (forex) markets, commodity values, and capital movements. The nation’s dependence on imported crude oil and vulnerability to foreign investments increase its exposure to these geopolitical disturbances. For example, the forex market responds quickly to geopolitical instability, causing the Indian rupee to weaken when safe-haven currencies gain strength, which can increase import costs and inflation, especially regarding oil prices. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) frequently exit emerging markets amid geopolitical tensions, causing substantial drops in equity indices such as the Nifty 50 and Sensex. This trend shows a relationship between global risk appetite and market movements in India. ",
      "The research seeks to examine the influence of geopolitical elements on India's financial markets, investigating both short-term and long-term effects on currency rates, stock indices, capital movements, bond yields, and commodity prices. Through the analysis of recent geopolitical events, the study aims to improve insights into risk transmission in India's financial system and recommend measures to strengthen economic resilience. "

          "India has maintained strong, time- tested strategic diplomatic relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Russia and India marks its 78 years of diplomatic engagement which have been strong since the Cold War and the beginning was marked after the resolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ever since it has maintained strong relations, tightening it through the signing of “Declaration on the India-Russia Strategic Partnership” in October 2000 and “Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership” in 2010 which enhanced the levels of cooperation in areas of defence, security, trade and economy, science and technology and culture. In 2023-24 reports, Russia stands as the fourth largest trade partner of India with bilateral trade of $65.5 Billion in present mainly in crude oil, coal, nuclear energy and defence equipment’s. Its contribution has been the most in defence accounting for India's top military 36% of total defence imports where the relations has progressed from a mere buyer seller to one involving development, advancement and research in the field (Ministry of External Affairs).",
          "Regarding India’s relation with Ukraine, it was one of the first countries to recognize Ukraine as a sovereign country in December 1991. The relationship has primarily revolved around trade, education, and cooperation in areas such as science and technology, defense repair services, and pharmaceuticals. Ukraine has been a key exporter of agricultural products like sunflower oil and corn to India, while India has exported pharmaceuticals, machinery, and chemicals. A significant aspect of the relationship is the presence of thousands of Indian students, particularly in medical universities across Ukraine, which has fostered people-to-people ties."

        heading: "India’s stance on Russia Ukraine Conflict",
        paragraphs: [
          "India’s response to the Russia- Ukraine conflict shows a carefully calibrated balancing act rooted in strategic autonomy, non- alignment and national interest. India chose to abstain from voting on UN resolutions that criticized Russia and called for an immediate cessation of violence. This diplomatic posture allowed India to preserve its long standing strategic and defence partnership with Russia. It also did not remain indifferent to Ukraine, where PM Narendra Modi became the first PM to visit Ukraine since 1991. It underscored its India’s commitment to human security without compromising geopolitical interests. The Indian Stock Market comprising BSE and NSE serves as a crucial barometer of economic growth and investor sentiment. As an emerging market, it has attracted domestic and foreign investments and has also been triggered by global geopolitical developments, particularly cross-border tensions and conflicts. The usual reactions in the market would be the change in volatility of stocks, which fuels future uncertainty. It is followed by loss in investor confidence, disruption in global supply chains and foreign portfolio investment. Sectors like defence, oil, and energy are especially sensitive to these developments, while some remain resilient, others face heightened volatility.",
          "From the history of shocks which affected Indian Stock market including Russia–Ukraine war, U.S.–China trade tensions, India–China border conflicts, and Middle East crises the pattern of reaction has been consistent. While equity markets may drop 3–7 per cent during major conflicts, it has been only temporary and short lived which has always been followed by growth and recovery.",
          "A major blow after the Covid pandemic which shook the global economy has been the Russia Ukraine conflict which took start on 24th February 2022. Russia and Ukraine are significant international players and contributing to trade in energy and oil. According to the stock data from NSE, the closing price of Nifty 50 had been 17063.25 one day prior to the conflict which dropped to 15863.15 just few days after the conflict broke, marking a 7% decline as investors reacted to the uncertainty. But it was only a initial spike in volatility and was followed by resilient growth and recovery by end of the year where the closing price reached 18105.3. A report by The Times of India noted BSE SENSEX to experience the worst fall in the last 2 years. It crashed by nearly 4,000 points in the first 20 days of war falling below 51,000 level. It later witnessed a upward trajectory where it reached 60,000 by the end of 2022. ",
          "Empirical studies have supported these observations. Madhvi Kaushik and Dr. Neeraj Kumar, using t-test analysis, revealed that there was a significant difference in Nifty 50 Index before and after the war. The primary explanation lies in India’s dependency on crude oil, edible oil, fertilisers, and defence supplies. Another study by Aaryash Bhandari and Amritkant Mishra to understand the impact of this conflict on specific sectoral indices revealed that war has created uncertainty among energy, oil and gas, real estate, IT, and FMCG sectors whereas metal, auto, and banking sector remained relatively stable.

          "IMFs article “The long lasting economic shock of war” named Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to destroy the global peace. The main effects had been the adverse economic trends, including rising inflation, poverty, food insecurity, deglobalization, and environmental degradation. India’s economic growth has been resilient and expanded 13.5% in the first quarter of 2022 but the real impact of this conflict was long term which reduced gdp growth to 6.3% by the second quarter. The inflation of India rose to a 8 year high of 7.79% after the conflict. This was mainly fuelled by the increase in global crude oil prices to $139 a barrel, due to global supply chain interruptions.",
          "The impact on consumer behaviour has been cutting down the expenditure on luxury, delaying the purchase of expensive goods and reallocating spending toward essentials due to price spike, demonstrating the classic substitution effect and income effect from consumer theory. . The consumer sentiment index, tracked by CMIE, rose steadily until February 2022 but slowed down reflecting the dampening confidence post conflict. The pattern also revealed consumers moving to digital and e- commerce platforms attracted by discounts and looking for sustainable options. There was much dependence on public transport due to the hike in petrol prices as well. ",
          "In conclusion, the Russia–Ukraine conflict served as a stress test for India's economic stability, stock market resilience, and consumer adaptability. While the immediate shocks were mitigated through strategic policy responses and market recovery, the long-term implications call for greater economic preparedness. While such a balancing stance invites invites criticism from both sides, it also enhances India’s credibility as a nation capable of mediating complex global crises through dialogue, pragmatism, and sovereign decision-making."

        paragraphs: [
          "The continuing struggle between Israel and Hamas, which flared up dramatically in October 2023, has significant repercussions extending beyond the Middle East. The global financial system has been significantly impacted, particularly the foreign exchange (FX) markets in emerging economies such as India. Due to the conflict causing fluctuations in energy prices, increasing geopolitical risks, and impacting global investor sentiment, the Indian rupee (INR) faced increased strain. The resulting changes in capital movements, import expenses, and inflation outlooks have put the Indian foreign exchange market in a responsive position, highlighting the nation’s susceptibility to external geopolitical disturbances. ",
          "India ranks among the largest global importers of crude oil, fulfilling over 85% of its energy needs through imports. A substantial share of this supply comes from the Middle East, especially via the Strait of Hormuz—a vital passage for worldwide oil. The intensification of the Israel–Hamas conflict heightened concerns about a broader regional war that could include Iran, Lebanon, or additional Gulf nations. Any involvement of this nature could jeopardize oil supplies, interrupt transport routes, and increase global crude oil prices. Consequently, Brent crude prices surged significantly, surpassing the $90-per-barrel threshold in the initial stages of the conflict before displaying some indicators of stabilization amid diplomatic initiatives. This rise in costs increased India’s import expenses, adding more pressure on the trade deficit and worsening current account issues. ",
          "The direct result of increased oil prices was a decline in the value of the Indian rupee. In October–November 2023, the rupee declined to approximately Rs. 86.75–86.80 per U.S. dollar, indicating a notable depreciation compared to earlier in the year. A declining rupee increases import costs and contributes to inflationary pressure, particularly when paired with elevated energy prices. This, consequently, could influence consumer expenditure and growth outlooks in the overall economy. Market players attentively monitored the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which took measures to control the currency’s fluctuations. The RBI disbursed dollars from its reserves to mitigate the decline and employed forward market operations to reassure expectations. ",
          "Although geopolitical risks have long existed in the Indian FX market, the uniqueness of this event lies in its timing and its overlap with other global economic challenges. India, similar to various emerging markets, was already facing the effects of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s restrictive monetary policy. Increased interest rates in the U.S. enhance the appeal of dollar-denominated investments for international investors, frequently resulting in capital flight from more volatile emerging markets. The Israel–Hamas conflict introduced further uncertainty, causing foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to withdraw investments from Indian equity and debt markets. In October and November 2023, FPIs were net sellers in Indian stocks, increasing the downward pressure on the rupee. ",
          "The RBI's action extended beyond spot markets. It also utilized tools such as variable rate reverse repos (VRRR) to take in surplus liquidity and uphold stability in money markets. Furthermore, forward premium rates—the expense of safeguarding against future currency fluctuations—experienced an increase during the crisis's height, indicating that corporations and institutional investors were more actively pursuing protection against additional rupee decline. Nonetheless, the currency markets exhibited comparatively lower volatility than in past geopolitical occurrences, suggesting that the RBI's macroprudential framework had developed in its ability to handle external shocks. ",
          "Another essential aspect was the effect on inflation. A weaker rupee along with more expensive oil imports resulted in increased pressure on wholesale and retail prices. The inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which had eased earlier in 2023, rose slightly once more, raising worries about the RBI’s capability to uphold its inflation targeting goal. Despite core inflation being kept in check by steady food prices, the overall inflation figures raised concerns among policymakers. Analysts pondered whether the RBI would maintain its pause on raising interest rates or adopt a more aggressive stance if inflationary pressures remained. ",
          "Notably, although the rupee encountered difficulties, it demonstrated strength against other emerging market currencies, thanks to India's comparatively robust macroeconomic fundamentals. Foreign exchange reserves stayed strong at more than $590 billion, reassuring markets that the central bank could uphold the rupee if necessary. Additionally, India's GDP expansion continued to be among the quickest worldwide, bolstering investor trust in the medium term. This relative strength enabled the rupee to rebound in late December 2023 and January 2024, with the currency briefly reaching Rs. 86.05 per dollar as crude prices fell to $67–69 per barrel during ceasefire discussions and decreased regional tensions.", "Additionally, the Israel–Hamas conflict highlighted the strategic necessity for India to diversify its energy import sources and strengthen energy security. India intensified its long-term agreements with Russia, the U.S., and African nations to lessen reliance on the Middle East. Policymakers have also intensified their efforts for the development of alternate energy sources, such as solar and green hydrogen, within the larger Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) framework. ",
          "From a wider economic viewpoint, the conflict influenced investor confidence, especially for firms with supply chain or trade connections in West Asia. The Indian government observed developments carefully and undertook diplomatic initiatives to reduce tensions, fully aware that a prolonged conflict might escalate into a broader regional war, with significantly greater economic ramifications. Moreover, the conflict revealed the vulnerability of international payment networks and supply chains to geopolitical disturbances, highlighting the importance of strategic risk management, budgetary caution, and sufficient sovereign reserves. ",
          "Ultimately, the Israel–Hamas conflict has noticeably influenced India’s foreign exchange market, operating via increased oil prices, heightened investor risk aversion, capital flight, and inflation anticipations. Despite an initial depreciation of the rupee, timely actions by the RBI, strong macroeconomic indicators, and sturdy external accounts aided in reducing significant repercussions. Nonetheless, the incident underscored India's vulnerability to worldwide disruptions and the significance of strategic economic oversight to sustain currency and financial stability. In the future, the performance of the FX market will depend on global crude oil trends, geopolitical events in West Asia, the Fed’s interest rate decisions, and India’s structural reforms and fiscal policy decisions.

          "The Russia-Ukraine war, which escalated in February 2022, has had profound repercussions on global economies and financial markets. India, despite being geographically distant and politically non-aligned, faced significant spill over effects, particularly in its money market — a crucial segment for short-term borrowing and lending that influences liquidity, interest rates, and inflation control.",
          "1. Crude Oil Prices and Inflationary Pressures", "Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer, and the conflict led to global sanctions against Russian energy exports, reducing supply and spiking global oil prices. Brent crude crossed $120 per barrel in March 2022, compared to around $78 per barrel in December 2021 (Source: Statista). For India, which imports about 85% of its crude oil, this meant a sharp rise in import bills, leading to inflationary pressures.",
          "India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation shot up to 7.8% in April 2022, well above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target of 4-6%. In response, the RBI raised the repo rate from 4% in May 2022 to 6.5% by February 2023, tightening liquidity in the money market. This caused a direct spike in short-term interest rates, impacting the yields of Treasury Bills (T-Bills), Certificates of Deposit (CDs), and Commercial Papers (CPs).",
          "2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) Outflows",
          "The geopolitical uncertainty drove risk aversion globally. FPIs began withdrawing from emerging markets, including India, to move into safer assets like U.S. Treasuries. Between February and June 2022, India saw FPI outflows of over Rs. 2.6 lakh crore, especially from the debt segment (Source: NSDL). These capital outflows led to a depreciation of the Indian Rupee, which touched Rs. 81.5/USD in September 2022, compared to Rs. 74/USD in January 2022 (Source: RBI). The rupee depreciation added to inflationary concerns and prompted the RBI to conduct Open Market Operations (OMOs) and currency market interventions, thereby affecting liquidity conditions in the money market.",
          "3. Liquidity Crunch and Volatility in Yields",
          "As inflation rose and the RBI began tightening monetary policy, the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) — a key money market indicator — increased from around 3.3% in January 2022 to 6.4% by March 2023. The demand for short-term funds increased, while supply remained restricted due to the RBI’s policy stance.",

          "•	364-day T-Bill yield: From 4.3% to 7.1% during the same period (Source: RBI)",
          "Such yield increases make short-term borrowing costlier for businesses and banks, reducing credit availability and investment activity.",
          "4. Government Borrowing and Fiscal Pressure",
          "Higher oil prices widened India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) to 3.7% of GDP in Q2 FY23. To manage fiscal stress, the government increased market borrowings. The increased supply of government securities added pressure on the short-term yield curve in the money market.",
          "The Russia-Ukraine conflict has impacted India’s money market by creating inflationary pressure, triggering interest rate hikes, causing FPI outflows, and increasing volatility in short-term instruments. While the Indian economy has shown resilience, the geopolitical tension has underscored the vulnerability of financial markets to global events.",

The market went through fluctuations during the initial phase, with gains and losses as investors were hesitant and careful in the wake of the Pahalgam attack. On April 25, the Sensex posted a 600-point decline (about 0.74%) to settle around 79,212, continuing its slide into the week’s end. For investors and market stakeholders, this rise in geopolitical risk brought about a new wave of uncertainty and heavily impacted sectors that are sensitive to global sentiment—defense, energy, and aviation were among the first to feel the strain.",
          "Between May 5, 2025, and May 9, 2025, when India executed military operations targeting nine locations throughout Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the Nifty 50 index experienced significant fluctuations.

The rally was driven by restored investor confidence following the easing of geopolitical tensions. The ceasefire news is expected to boost market sentiment since the de-escalation alleviates a key source of investor anxiety and is likely to be regarded as a significant positive development by the financial markets.

          "India and Pakistan, born out of the partition of British India in 1947, have shared a turbulent relationship characterized by wars, border tensions and diplomatic standoffs. At the core of their conflict lies the long-standing Kashmir dispute, which has been the flashpoint for most military confrontations, including the wars of 1947, 1965, 1971, and the 1999 Kargil conflict. One such recent event was the Pahalgam terrorist attack in June 2025. This act of terror not only reignited geopolitical tensions but also sent ripples through Indian financial markets.",
          "Following the Pahalgam attack, the Indian stock market witnessed a sharp decline, reflecting investor nervousness amid fears of rising conflict. The benchmark indices such as the Sensex and Nifty dipped in the immediate aftermath, driven by sectors sensitive to geopolitical risk, such as banking, infrastructure, and travel. Historically, such attacks have led to short-term volatility, as markets react to uncertainty over national security, foreign relations, and potential retaliatory actions.",

Although Gift Nifty indicated a lower opening, both Sensex and Nifty rose shortly after markets opened despite geopolitical tensions. On May 7, 2025, the Sensex began 692 points down but recovered to gain over 200 points, remaining volatile and slightly down around 10 AM. The Nifty 50 also declined initially but made gains later in the day. The Indian rupee opened 19 paise lower against the US dollar, with investors favoring safe-haven assets leading to a slight increase in gold prices. Government bond yields showed stability in early trading. In contrast, Pakistan’s stock exchange plummeted by 5%, with the KSE-100 index dropping over 7.2%, indicating heightened investor fear regarding the country's economy.",
          "The conflict led to immediate disruptions, halting bilateral trade valued at $1.2 billion per year. Pakistan’s suspension of trade affected access to Indian pharmaceuticals and cotton, pushing import costs up by 20–30% through informal routes. India incurred losses from the closure of the Attari-Wagah border, projected at  Rs. 7,013 crore over five years, resulting in nearly 12,000 job losses. The 'war-like situation' hurt consumer sentiment, particularly in states like Punjab and Gujarat, where sales of discretionary products dropped by 20-50%. However, the ceasefire created potential for recovery in consumer goods demand.",
          "Inflation emerged as a concern, with a weaker rupee increasing import costs, especially for crude oil, while elevated defense spending posed risks to essential goods pricing. Pakistan's economy, already fragile with inflation over 38% and dependence on IMF bailouts, faced severe impacts, potentially leading to a currency crisis and shortages. Indian investors, particularly in mutual funds, remained composed, avoiding panic sell-offs and taking advantage of market dips, particularly in defense and energy sectors. While foreign institutional investors might show temporary caution, they leaned toward Indian large-cap companies for growth prospects amid global stagnation. ",
          "Historically, Indian markets have shown resilience against geopolitical tensions, with modest declines followed by recoveries. The analysis of previous conflicts indicates a consistent pattern of markets recovering rapidly post-tension. Current investor behavior indicates a trend of focusing on long-term investments and weight on stability in sectors like healthcare and IT. Despite challenges, India’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong, bolstered by increasing FDI and the prospective India-UK Free Trade Agreement. Operation Sindoor's impact on markets appears contained, signaling opportunities rather than panic, while investor caution against scams is critical amidst the operation's geopolitical implications."

        heading: "Impact of the 1962 Indo-China War on India’s Foreign Exchange Market",
        paragraphs: [
          "The 1962 Indo-China War between India and China not only represented a military encounter but also served as a critical economic shock, prompting India to reshape its developmental agenda. The brief conflict led to increased defense spending, a strain on foreign exchange reserves, and a shift in foreign exchange policies during a period dominated by the Second Five-Year Plan, which focused on public sector investments and import-led industrialization. The abrupt pivot towards defense readiness destabilized India's already fragile balance of payments (BoP).",
          "Defense expenditure surged from Rs. 200 crore in 1961–62 to Rs. 460 crore by 1965–66—an increase of over 130%—primarily due to the urgent need for military equipment, which had to be imported from countries like the U.S. and USSR, thus exerting substantial pressure on India’s limited foreign reserves. Concurrently, the trade deficit ballooned from Rs. 196 crore in 1961–62 to Rs. 663 crore by 1965–66, driven not just by defense imports but also an escalating dependence on imports for essentials such as oil and food grains, further complicating the economic scenario.",
          "Foreign exchange reserves, which stood at approximately $705 million in 1958, began to dwindle, falling to around $400 million by 1965. This decline stemmed from heightened payments for military imports and reduced remittances, coupled with weak export earnings amid pricing pressures internationally. The current account deficit, reaching nearly 3% of GDP in the mid-1960s, indicated significant stress on India’s external financial position. ",
          "To address the resulting financing gap, India sought aid from international financial institutions, with over $1.5 billion received from the U.S.-backed Aid India Consortium between 1961 and 1966. However, this aid often came with stipulations for India to undertake structural reforms including fiscal discipline and trade liberalization. The necessity to stabilize its BoP led to the devaluation of the Indian rupee in 1966, shrinking its value by 36.5%. While intended to bolster export competitiveness, the devaluation spurred domestic inflation and political discontent due to its adverse economic effects. ",
          "The post-war period saw increased rupee volatility, compelling the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to intervene actively. In light of the crisis, the government imposed stringent exchange control measures, including regulations on foreign currency transactions and foreign travel, setting the stage for the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) of 1973, rooted in the vulnerabilities revealed by the war.",
          "India’s strategy evolved towards Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) to mitigate the forex crises. The government incentivized local production of essential goods and defense equipment while tightening industrial licensing to curtail imports. Recognizing the weaknesses in its export base, India implemented various export promotion schemes. Nonetheless, these efforts led to the entrenchment of a high-cost industrial structure that would later complicate reforms.",
          "The conflict and devaluation culminated in cost-push inflation, with prices rising significantly, especially affecting the urban poor, leading to political unrest. The inflation undermined developmental targets, forcing policymakers to adjust their objectives amidst external economic pressures.",
          "Geopolitically, the war prompted India to pivot closer to the Soviet Union, an opportunity to reduce dollar dependency through rupee trade agreements. This shift altered India’s foreign exchange landscape, allowing temporary relief while complicating trade balance efforts. Overall, the 1962 Indo-China War catalyzed a significant transformation in India's economic policies and foreign exchange management, revealing critical structural weaknesses in its import-driven strategy and reliance on external aid. In response, India adopted stringent exchange controls and pursued a policy of self-reliance through import substitution, leading to a tightly regulated economic framework that persisted until the 1990s liberalization.",
          "Thus, the war instigated a re-evaluation of India’s development priorities, establishing forex management as a central tenet of macroeconomic policy. It represented a pivotal moment in India's economic history, reshaping the nation's approach to foreign exchange for decades."

    conclusion: [
      "The results of this research demonstrate that geopolitical stressors—including wars, border conflicts, and global confrontations—have a profound and complex impact on the Indian financial markets. Although India may not frequently participate in these events directly, the interdependence of global trade, capital, and energy markets guarantees that any major geopolitical upheaval quickly impacts India’s stock exchanges, currency rates, money market instruments, and commodity prices. ",
      "Incidents like the Russia–Ukraine war, the Israel–Hamas conflict, the 2025 Pahalgam terrorist attack, and the following Operation Sindoor emphasize the effect of global and regional turmoil on India's economic metrics. Such disruptions frequently result in greater uncertainty, amplified volatility, capital flight, and inflationary stress—particularly via the oil import route. The significant increase in crude oil prices and the depreciation of the rupee during these conflicts directly affected India’s import expenses, inflation, and interest rates. The exit of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in these situations, as observed during the Russia–Ukraine conflict and the Israel–Hamas crisis, exacerbates instability in financial markets, indicating a global aversion to risk and a drop in investor confidence.",
      "Despite these disruptions, the Indian economy and markets have repeatedly demonstrated notable strength. Historically, both the Sensex and Nifty indices have faced brief downturns followed by consistent recoveries, supported by robust macroeconomic indicators, timely policy actions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and investor faith in India's long-term growth narrative. In instances like Operation Sindoor, early volatility transitioned to investor confidence after the easing of hostilities, indicating that markets tend to react favorably to stability and clear geopolitical narratives. ",
      "The research emphasizes the essential function of the RBI in supporting the rupee and ensuring liquidity stability via its monetary instruments—like open market operations, currency interventions, and interest rate modifications. Likewise, the government's diplomatic balancing efforts, like sustaining strategic relationships with Russia while providing humanitarian support to Ukraine, demonstrate India's policy adaptability in a multipolar environment. ",
      "A major insight is that investor behavior is very responsive to perceived geopolitical risk, influencing not just equity markets but also currency markets, inflation expectations, and consumption trends. During crises, consumer expenditure often shifts from non-essential to essential items, while the demand for safe investments such as gold or government bonds increases. The 1962 Indo-China conflict provides a historical perspective on how such clashes can alter macroeconomic policy, foreign exchange tactics, and even long-term development planning. ",
      "In summary, although geopolitical stressors are external and unforeseeable, their economic impacts are significant and necessitate readiness, policy flexibility, and strategic vision. Moving ahead, boosting India's energy security, broadening trade alliances, increasing foreign exchange reserves, and establishing robust fiscal protections will be vital to shielding the financial system from these external disruptions. Additionally, educating investors and implementing financial market reforms should focus on fostering confidence and reducing reactions driven by panic. This research highlights the necessity for ongoing surveillance, analytics-based predictions, and cooperative economic diplomacy to safeguard and stabilize India’s financial framework amidst a more turbulent geopolitical landscape.

      "The digital revolution has precipitated a paradigm shift in modern society, weaving a complex tapestry of interconnected systems and networks. As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are becoming increasingly ephemeral. However, this heightened reliance on digital technologies has also introduced a plethora of vulnerabilities and risks. Cybercrimes, in particular, have emerged as a pernicious threat to global security, economic stability, and individual privacy (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2022; World Bank, 2023). The alarming proliferation of cyber-attacks, data breaches, and other forms of cyber malfeasance has compromised sensitive information, disrupted critical infrastructure, and eroded trust in digital systems (IBM, 2021; ITU, 2023). The economic implications of cybercrime are staggering, with estimated losses projected to reach unprecedented levels in the coming years.The intangible nature of cyber threats makes them uniquely difficult to detect, track, and counteract. The continuous evolution of technology necessitates a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that encompasses technological innovation, regulatory frameworks, and individual awareness and education (NIST, 2023; European Commission, 2022).",
      "In this article, we delve into the complex and evolving landscape of cybercrimes, examining the current threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences of cyber-attacks. We also discuss the need for effective security policy reforms, highlighting the importance of cybersecurity awareness and training, software and hardware updates, incident response planning, and international cooperation."

          "Cybercrimes have undergone a significant transformation in recent years, evolving from simplistic attacks to sophisticated and targeted threats (IEEE Cybersecurity Brief, 2023). The increasing complexity of cyber-attacks can be attributed to the growing sophistication of malicious actors, who are leveraging advanced technologies and techniques to compromise digital systems (Gundu, T., & Flowerday, S. V. (2023). Over the past decade, technology has undergone a revolutionary transformation, seamlessly integrating into our daily lives and fundamentally altering the way we interact, communicate, and conduct business. This exponential growth has been accompanied by an equally alarming rise in cybercrimes, with the global economy losing an estimated $6 trillion to cybercrime in 2021 alone (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2022).",
          "Cybercrimes have advanced beyond basic hacking, now encompassing sophisticated techniques such as ransomware deployment, malware infections, and social engineering. According to Cybersecurity Ventures (2022), the global economy is projected to lose over $10.5 trillion by 2025. Many organizations and individuals use outdated software and hardware, making them vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the need for effective cybersecurity strategies has become urgent and unavoidable. Without proactive and coordinated efforts, individuals, businesses, and governments face significant and long-lasting repercussions"

For instance, a ransomware attack on Baltimore in 2020 resulted in a loss of over $10 million (Baltimore Sun, 2020). Similarly, a cyberattack on Equifax in 2017 compromised the sensitive information of over 147 million people (Equifax, 2017).",
          "It is expected that the annual cybercrime costs globally might reach up to $10.5 trillion by 2025 (Morgan, 2020). Such costs include data breaches and damage, intrusion of privacy, loss of productivity, financial theft, embezzlement, and system hacking. Various day-to-day encounters are seen wherein the victim falls into traps designed by cybercriminals using persuasive tactics.",
          "Losses due to such financial frauds have amounted to ₹11,269 Crore INR for India alone (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2024), with most of the scams traced back to China or China-linked entities. The rise of the underground economy, where malware, hacking tools, and services are traded, reflects how deeply embedded cybercrime has become. Cybercrime as a service has enabled individuals with malicious intent to exploit technology and talent for harmful ends (IEEE Cybersecurity Brief, 2023). ",
          "Industries such as healthcare, hospitality, and financial services are especially vulnerable, requiring continuous improvements in data governance, incident response, and investments in both security technologies and preventive strategies (IBM, 2021). Even in sectors with established compliance measures, like healthcare, breaches continue to occur (World Bank, 2023). This highlights the importance of sharing threat intelligence and building resilient infrastructure.Ultimately, the economic and structural implications of cybersecurity underscore the need for cautious, informed, and sustained investment in safeguarding the digital world.

    intro: [
      "The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), passed by the Indian government in 2005, is widely recognized as the world’s largest rural employment scheme. The core idea behind MGNREGA is straightforward: to ensure that every rural household in India can access up to 100 days of paid work each year by doing unskilled manual labor. This is not just a welfare measure, it is a legal right. Any adult in rural India who wants such work can demand it from the government, which is then legally bound to provide employment within 15 days or pay an unemployment allowance. ",
      "The scheme is run mainly through Gram Panchayats (local village councils), who help identify local infrastructure needs and supervise the work. This decentralized approach promotes transparency, encourages participation from villagers, and increases public accountability through social audits and open meetings. ",
      "A unique feature of MGNREGA is its focus on building rural infrastructure as part of the employment given. This includes creating key assets like ponds, roads, small irrigation canals, and water conservation projects. These infrastructure works help not only to support agriculture and local economies, but also to address one of India’s pressing challenges: distress migration from villages to cities. By providing work close to home within 5km if possible and especially during times when farm jobs are scarce, MGNREGA helps keep families together and discourages risky and forced seasonal migration. Research shows that this has slowed or reduced distress-driven migration in many areas. ",
      "The program also pays special attention to women and marginalized groups, requiring that at least one-third of total workers be women, and ensuring equal pay for men and women alike. These rights are further protected by provisions for timely wage payments, workplace facilities (such as drinking water and first aid), and grievance redress mechanisms. ",
      "As a landmark law, MGNREGA is considered the last major independent rights-based social legislation in India. It shifted welfare policy from discretionary aid to a legally enforceable right, representing a more participatory, transparent, and citizen-focused approach to rural development and social protection. ",
      "While MGNREGA has been significant in addressing rural unemployment, there exists a gap when it comes to urban unemployment. Currently, there exists no single central act in India that offers a nationwide urban employment guarantee like MGNREGA. ",
      "This gap is especially notable given the increasing urbanization and issues with it. A national urban employment guarantee act has been introduced and reported to include discussion and proposals of the act, such as The Bhagat Singh National Urban Employment Guarantee Bill, 2022, but none yet exist as a central law. We have programs like the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), which are considered whole missions and not legally binding employment guarantee acts. ",
      "To address this gap, state governments across India have made efforts to establish their own employment guarantee acts. These schemes, typically framed with reference to the Act of MGNREGA, have succeeded in providing some security for urban informal labourers. Examples include Kerala's Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (AUEGS), Rajasthan's Indira Gandhi Shahri Rozgar Guarantee Yojana, Himachal Pradesh's Mukhya Mantri Shahri Ajeevika Guarantee Yojna, Odisha's Mukhya Mantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan (MUKTA), Jharkhand's Mukhyamantri Shramik Yojana, and the Tamil Nadu Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme.",
      "The development of urban legislation is based on the nature of the migration systems from rural to urban areas. Migration studies have found that most migrants migrate from rural to urban areas for improved employment opportunities and higher wages. However, the 'spillover of rural poverty' into the urban area leads to the migrants experiencing either stagnated or reduced income levels despite migrating from rural to urban areas of higher economic amenities. Shockingly, while 94% of the migrants were above the poverty line before they migrated, they dropped to only 88.18% of now staying above the urban poverty line. Clearly, the direction of the rural-to-urban migration is not guaranteed to increase economic stability. Moreover, these patterns of migration have increased unemployment rates in urban areas and decreased agricultural production in rural areas. ",
      "Therefore, the case for a national urban employment guarantee scheme is even more urgent now, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has sharply highlighted the extreme vulnerability of urban informal workers, many of whom lost their livelihoods overnight. In April 2020, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimated that there was a potential loss of 2.5 crore jobs worldwide from the economic crisis of the pandemic. The ILO recognized that the crisis could push over 40 crore informal workers in India, who do not have social security, further into poverty because of the economic fallout. In addition, beyond the crisis faced by the pandemic, informal workers constantly face insecurity of work without social security, fair wages, and job security.",

        heading: "Policy Framework ",
        paragraphs: [
          "The problem stream for MGNREGA emerged from chronic rural distress in India. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, rural wage growth had largely stagnated – agricultural wages were rising only ~1–1.4% per year during 2000–05 – and many farm households remained vulnerable to seasonal unemployment. Persistent poverty and drought-prone agriculture underscored an urgent need for guaranteed work. Civil society and grassroots movements (notably the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan and allied groups) seized on this problem, campaigning for a formal “right to work” as a policy solution. Drawing on experiences with earlier “food-for-work” programs and state-level employment schemes, activists and experts drafted a blueprint for a nationwide employment guarantee. By 2003–04, a pan-India campaign had mobilized tens of thousands of rural laborers and generated a model bill for a rural jobs guarantee. This evidence and debate helped solidify an actionable policy stream: a legal guarantee of 100 days’ work for rural households, with statutory wages and accountability mechanisms. ",
          "The politics stream crystallised after the 2004 general elections. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) narrowly won power with outside support from leftist parties. The UPA had pledged a right-to-work guarantee in its 2004 manifesto, reflecting the political salience of rural distress. Left parties (Communist Party of India and allies) insisted that a national employment-guarantee be the very first item in the UPA’s National Common Minimum Programme. This coalition context created a policy window: the new government, under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (2004–09), faced both electoral incentives and external pressure to enact an ambitious rural employment law. Key policy entrepreneurs seized this opportunity. Members of the National Advisory Council (NAC) – a body chaired by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi and including activists like Aruna Roy – worked out the details of the guarantee in early 2005. Veteran activists such as Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey used their credibility to frame the scheme as a legal right, urging its passage in Parliament. In the summer of 2005, these streams coupled: the UPA government, pressed by left allies and civil-society advocates, introduced and enacted the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. (MGNREGA was gazetted in August 2005 and came into force in early 2006.) In short, widespread recognition of rural poverty combined with a mature policy proposal and a supportive coalition government – marshaled by determined policy entrepreneurs – to open the policy window for MGNREGA.",

Recruit more engineers, gram rozgaar sevaks and support staff so that projects can be planned and executed promptly. Provide regular capacity-building programs to ensure officials understand MGNREGA rules (e.g. asset guidelines, wage calculations) and can process payments on time.",
          "•	Social audit coverage: The Act mandates community audits in every gram panchayat at least twice a year. Ensure this mandate is met uniformly: fund state-level Social Audit Units, train independent auditors, and publicize audit findings. Encouraging civil society participation (NGOs, media) in audits will improve transparency. For example, by mid-2022, twenty-seven states and one UT had established independent social audit units; the goal now is to achieve full participation and regular audits in the remaining areas.",
          "•	Grievance redressal: Expand and streamline complaint mechanisms. Set up toll-free helplines (at least one per district) and digital grievance portals that log every complaint and its resolution status. Designate district-level officers (e.g. a grievance redressal commissioner) to oversee timely case resolution. Publicise average resolution times. Encourage use of SMS or mobile apps (e.g. Janmanrega) so beneficiaries can report delays in payment, job card issues, or wage theft.",
          "•	Local governance: Deepen the role of panchayats and Gram Sabhas. Mandate that village plans explicitly list MGNREGA works, and link fund releases to approval by the Gram Sabha. Strengthen village employment councils (VELC) to monitor muster rolls and work quality. Provide training to elected panchayat members on MGNREGA, and hold Gram Sabhas to review scheme performance quarterly. Empowering local leaders (sarpanches, panchayat secretaries) will help detect malpractices early and align projects with community needs."

        paragraphs: [
          "•	Digital payment and MIS integration: Fully implement end-to-end e-governance. All wage payments should be disbursed via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) into worker bank accounts. Use the NREGASoft MIS platform (as already deployed) to capture every step: job card issuance, job demand registration, muster roll entry, and payment. This reduces delays, avoids cash leakages and enables real-time oversight of funds. Ensure network and computer facilities at all blocks/GPs so data is entered promptly.",
          "•	Mobile monitoring and geotagging: Scale up use of mobile apps for field monitoring. The National Mobile Monitoring Service (NMMS) app, for instance, records daily attendance with geotagged photos, curbing ghost entries. Extend such biometric and GPS-enabled tools to every site: e.g. require foremen to mark muster rolls via smartphone apps that capture worker fingerprints and timestamps. An “Area Officer Monitoring” app (already piloted) can allow state officials to file time-stamped, geotagged inspection reports in real time. These measures increase citizen oversight and make discrepancies immediately visible.",
          "•	Citizen feedback tools: Promote user-friendly digital interfaces for beneficiaries. The government’s “Janmanrega” mobile app (a citizen feedback tool) should be widely advertised, so workers can quickly report issues or rate completed assets. Maintain public dashboards (on the NREGA website) showing state- and district-level data on works, wages and delays, updated monthly. Enable SMS updates in local languages (for example, on wage credit notifications). Together, these digital channels will boost transparency and allow instant field intelligence from the ground.",

        paragraphs: [
          "•	Target migration-prone areas: Use local data to anticipate seasonal migration and direct MGNREGA work accordingly. Districts should map villages with high outmigration (e.g. via household surveys or past muster data). In those areas, pre-assign additional work targets and materials so that employment is readily available. Maharashtra’s Nandurbar district, for example, ran a “Nandadeep” pilot identifying migrant families and ensuring local jobs on demand. Replicating such targeted pilots can help lock in MGNREGA gains by giving at-risk households timely work.",
          "•	Livelihood-enhancing works: Prioritize MGNREGA projects that boost agriculture and non-farm income in lean seasons. Invest in water harvesting and irrigation (farm ponds, tanks, check dams) and horticulture (orchard planting) in drought-prone villages. These assets complement farming – as seen in Nandurbar, where a tribal farmer built a drip-irrigation pond and mango orchard under MGNREGA, enabling two crops per year and eliminating his need to migrate. By scheduling more such works during summer or pre-monsoon months, the scheme can smooth rural income fluctuations and reduce distress migration.",
          "•	Portable entitlements: Strengthen portability of MGNREGA benefits for migrants. Publicize that any rural worker with a job card can demand 100 days’ work in any district (and claim an unemployment allowance if work is delayed). Coordinate with urban employment and welfare programs so that returning migrants can immediately re-enter local MGNREGA work. For instance, maintain a current registry of returning migrants each season to preemptively issue job cards or muster rolls. By aligning the scheme’s operations with known migration cycles, MGNREGA can serve both as a rural safety net and as a buffer against destabilizing labor shifts.",
          "By addressing these gaps with practical steps, MGNREGA can more effectively fulfil its promise of rural livelihood security. Strengthening administration, leveraging technology for transparency, and proactively integrating migration considerations will help ensure that the Act’s legal guarantees translate into real work and income for India’s rural poor."

          "MGNREGA’s centralized framework aims to stabilize rural livelihoods. This paper synthesizes qualitative evidence to assess how mgnrega fosters employment stability. In this analysis, we have taken case studies from five states i.e. Rajasthan, Karnataka, Odisha, Jammu & kashmir and West Bengal, collected between 2018-2023. MGNREGA’s strength lies in its centralized design run by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) in which every rural household has the right to 100 days of work. Wages go directly to the bank account of the beneficiaries via National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS). Digital records ensure availability and authenticity of the central database. Fair wages allotted by the central government ensures workers are not underpaid and extra workdays are added in case of emergencies like COVID-19. Local Gram Panchayats make it easier, but their effectiveness varies from region to region. ",

          "To conclude, MGNREGA is a lifeline for rural India, giving families steady work, fair pay, and hope during tough times. From Rajasthan’s villages to Odisha’s fields, it cut migration and empowered women. But inconsistent funding, tech hiccups, and uneven local efforts hold it back. With smarter budgets, better data, and a focus on women and climate-friendly projects, MGNREGA can keep being India’s strongest shield against rural poverty. ",

Prior to MGNREGA's implementation, rural-to-urban migration constituted approximately 87% of total economic migration in the country. The primary source states for out-migration included Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh, regions characterized by high agricultural dependence, limited irrigation facilities, and seasonal unemployment patterns.",
          "The 2007-08 National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data revealed that nearly 79% of rural male migrants and 56% of urban male migrants moved primarily due to employment-related reasons. The predominant migration streams showed rural-to-rural migration as the largest category, particularly among women due to marriage-related movement, while male migration was increasingly driven by economic necessity. Seasonal migration, in particular, had become a critical livelihood strategy for poor rural households, with migrants typically working in construction, brick kilns, agriculture, and urban informal sectors during agricultural lean seasons.",

          "The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provides an integrated approach to rural development, economic stability, social development, and asset creation, in addition to offering jobs for the poor. MGNREGA's success stems from its ability to address a wide range of issues. ",
          "By directly generating job opportunities, the program helps many people secure their livelihoods. In addition to improving food security and lowering poverty, this has also improved health and education. Research shows that participants save and earn more money (5–9%) and eat better. MGNREGA fosters a strong sense of self-worth and dignity among workers by enabling them to earn. Women's empowerment, which encourages their involvement and fosters financial independence, is one of its key features, with 79% of female employees collecting their wages on their own and 68% controlling their earnings (National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), as cited by Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in Financial Inclusion of Women: Current Evidence from India,2023). The program also demonstrates high participation from marginalised groups, with SCs accounting for 22.6% and STs for 17.6% of beneficiaries. ",
          "The development of durable assets that improve the rural economy is one of MGNREGA's primary goals. A significant 75% of projects directly benefit agriculture, and 87% of them are operational. These resources include water-saving structures, afforestation initiatives, and roads, which increase access and agricultural output. This close connection to agriculture promotes sustainable rural livelihoods and raises wages in rural areas. MGNREGA successfully lowers migration by offering job opportunities within 5 km of the applicant's home; notable instances include sharp declines in Anantapur (from 27% to 7%) and Bastar (from 4500 to 500 people). ",

For women, there is 1/3rd of registration placement, and in some areas, even 50% of the quota is reserved. People of rural areas desperately needed change and improvement in terms of infrastructure, gender-based development, and safeguarding marginalised and backward classes by employing them in their area, reducing distress migration. The program also provides welfare services like education, healthcare, and rationing through the public distribution system. It promotes empowerment through community participation by panchayat planning through gram Sabhas, giving the community a say about roads, water harvesting, structures, and land development. ",
          "The framework often helps uplift them by protecting them from caste-based discrimination, arbitrary exclusion, providing job cards, and ensuring transparency. A main feature for their welfare is the creation of durable assets for SC, ST communities, as their livelihood and employment are through land, by improving land productivity and infrastructure in areas predominantly inhabited by them. Land levelling, irrigation canals, and plantation of fallow lands directly help the farmers by increasing their long-term self-reliance. Other government schemes often lacked transparency, community participation, and accountability, making the population distrustful. With MGNREGA, rural people were prioritized by recognizing their employment needs and providing an equal base in society, overcoming hurdles, and using their skills. It has come out as a boon for the needy caste and class, helping the landless, empowering the disadvantaged, and creating useful assets at the ground level for rural development. ",
          "The MGNREGA Act provides guaranteed employment, but this is interconnected with rights. According to the constitution, fundamental rights include the right to employment without any failure or discrimination. However, the legal process of the policy is uncertain, and awareness regarding rights at the lower level is yet to be accomplished. Mere creation of a strict legal process for a rights-based approach is incomplete unless the population can recruit its benefits wholly. People face problems regarding legal application due to high illiteracy and low digital acceptance. The government should make the process of legality easy and smooth for those without full information or knowledge of their rights. A case in Rajasthan saw workers not receiving wages, status remaining pending, requiring government workers to ensure guaranteed employment and wages. ",
          "Challenges include corruption and mismanagement, which dislocate the purpose of the act by manipulating, ghosting workers with fake job cards, and imposing hierarchical structures that exclude the poor. Technological imbalance or barriers mean workers complain regarding Aadhaar card-linked documents, a lack of digital devices, internet access, or understanding of the process, making them soft targets for theft and scams, which leads to discontinuing participation, demanding rights, and complaining against the system. Underfunding and budget cuts have deeply impacted work areas and quality, with low funds causing some states to lag in creating proper employment opportunities with wages, undermining credibility. ",
          "MGNREGA's rights-based approach to development is still a bigger challenge to achieve. For promising, fair, and undivided rights, we need political commitment, community awareness, digital inclusion, and stronger awareness to get rid of the uncertainty of government institutions. Although there are various challenges like corruption, delayed wage payments, poor asset quality in some areas, and limited administrative capacity in low-income states, the high level of user satisfaction further supports MGNREGA's efficacy: 90% of those surveyed say the works are helpful.

        paragraphs: [
          "So far as we have discussed, we can see that MGNREGA as an act, as a policy, is primarily set to tackle the problem of rural unemployment. Rural employment is often a form of disguised unemployment. This often means a lower marginal product per unit of labor employed. However, there are also other forms of unemployment that affect the rural regions of this country, some of which are seasonal or cyclical in nature. MGNREGA, however, aims to solve the broader problem of unemployment. The model is very largely based on a project-infrastructure-employment framework. ",
          "To simply explain, this works primarily in a decentralized format. In this, projects are recorded, facilitated, and taken up by the local governance bodies, which are ultimately sent to the necessary administrative departments, and a budget is allocated. Once this is done, projects are undertaken, and necessary persons are employed. This is a very concise summary of how the projects work. This means, at large, or in an aggregate sense, the employment generated through the scheme also leads to infrastructure development in some form or another. ",
          "Here, we might tend to find some amount of difference or skewness between the number of projects employed and the budget allocated, or we may tend to find a slow rate of completion. But these are problems based on the implementation of the scheme, which may vary in nature from planning problems to political issues in a region or a district. This is one of the larger criticisms of the policy, which we won’t be addressing. However, looking at the general framework, we can see that if the policy is implemented with efficiency, there is a larger scope for rural development. ",
          "Addressing a few examples from a few states, we can list the following works undertaken at large. Statewide, in West Bengal, we see projects undertaken for: nursery raising on fruit and forest plants, vetiver seedling raising, hardening of banana tissue culture, establishment of poultry, piggery, goatery units, skill development training, land leveling, roads being built, integrated farming by IBS, vermicompost units, and re-excavation of ponds. These rural works undertaken or being focused upon shed light on how agricultural infrastructure is being prioritized. This means there is a positive indication, at least about the proposals of infrastructure, hinting at possible infrastructure growth along with employment in the region.",
          "Taking into consideration another state of a similar, or rather close, state-economy, Jammu and Kashmir has shown a very good record with the scheme's implementation and infrastructure, primarily seeing the development of roadways and projects related to water conservation and management. From a review of articles, it was found that Jammu and Kashmir has shown a rather positive trend with MGNREGA implementation and infrastructure development taking place because of the same. Coming to one more state of a similar size, we take the example of Odisha, where the following works are being and were reportedly undertaken: construction projects, water and irrigation management, rural sanitation initiatives, repair and maintenance of local infrastructure, land development efforts, drought-resistant projects, and provision of drinking water in rural areas, which again is a positive sign. In total, the act provides a list of permissible works, which includes several infrastructure initiatives, from water management in rural regions to agricultural activities and technologies, and forestry works. ",
          "To summarize and conclude the review of the relationship between employment under MGNREGA and infrastructure development, we can see that with MGNREGA, there is most certainly a scope for infrastructure development in the rural region, at least to the necessary sustenance levels and even more. The design of the policy facilitates infrastructure development, even though there might be some issues with the execution in some states. However, some states such as Jammu and Kashmir have shown a better governance and execution model. We can also say that with proper and timely executions after considering loopholes, we can see a very large scope for Rural Infrastructural Development.",

    conclusion: [
      "In conclusion, we can see that MGNREGA has several positive effects that accompany its proper implementation. A social audit reveals that MGNREGA has had a notably positive impact on its execution. While an assessment of the policy's implementation and employment output reveals several criticisms—primarily concerning migration, wage rates (which are a factor affecting migration even with the policy in place), and overall execution—these issues do not negate the fact that some positive change has been observed in several states. There has consistently been a significant number of beneficiaries, and the policy has had a visible positive impact. This suggests that while the policy may not be completely efficient (as no policy ever is), it is not entirely inefficient either. The positive changes observed indicate that with better implementation and improved management of the works, the policy could become far more efficient and lead to a substantial amount of rural development. Implementing any policy is challenging and can never be completely efficient, but if the planning and institutional frameworks are improved, the policy can certainly work to its near potential.",
      "Criticisms and Consequences",
      "1.	Wage-Related Issues ",
      "Beneficiaries are discouraged by low nominal salaries, which causes migration and underuse of the 100-day guarantee. Inadequate funding and administrative roadblocks, like frozen accounts or inactive Aadhaar, cause excessive and systematic delays in wage payments. Legally mandated compensation for unpaid wages is often not provided. Unjustified disparities result from the lack of a uniform wage rate among states and UTs. All things considered, the delay in wage payments brought on by fund transfer and administrative problems is a serious worry.",
      "2.	Implementation & Oversight Deficiencies ",
      "Unemployment benefits provisions that are poorly implemented result in an inadequate payout. Two significant shortcomings in social auditing practices are limited public access to reports and insufficient audit coverage. Grievance resolution is challenging due to low district ombudsperson appointment rates. A general lack of administrative and planning skills at the local (Panchayat) levels leads to inefficient budget utilisation. The use of machinery in place of manual labour and the prohibition of contractors are examples of violations of the scheme's objectives. Planning, approval, monitoring, and transparency are all hampered by a lack of technical and administrative staff at all levels (Block, Grama Panchayat). Additionally, this results in subpar planning and execution at the local level, which does not produce enough work. Inefficiencies are further aggravated by a lack of accountability and monitoring systems.",
      "3.	Corruption and Financial Misuse ",
      "Bribery for job cards, embezzlement by local officials, and the prevalence of ghost accounts are examples of widespread corruption. Fraudulent activities include making fake muster roll entries, using fake identities, and including deceased individuals. Only a tiny percentage of funds are allegedly able to reach recipients due to significant misappropriation. Two important problems that limit the scheme's actual benefits from reaching the workers are corruption and leaks.",
      "4.	Beneficiary Rights & Eligibility Issues ",
      "Beneficiaries are not aware of their rights and entitlements. The demand and supply of work among beneficiaries vary by season and location. Effective policy evaluation is hindered by inadequate monitoring systems and a lack of transparency. The requirement for Aadhaar-linked wage payments (ABPS) and seeding delays increases the risk of bank account mapping and seeding issues, which may lead to payment issues or beneficiary exclusion. Delays in payments discourage recipients and lower participation. Lack of funds reduces the number of workdays available. Concerns are raised over MGNREGA's slow approvals, which have an impact on rural livelihoods and employment opportunities.",
      "5.	Social and Beneficiary Difficulties ",
      "Delays in issuing job cards and discouragement from manual labour are examples of instances of discrimination against women and marginalised groups. Workplaces often lack basic amenities and safety measures, like childcare facilities. The rural poor's lack of awareness of their rights, such as the ability to obtain job cards, minimum wages, and unemployment benefits, impedes the demand for employment. Wasteful wage spending interferes with savings and financial inclusion, especially when cash is received. Since most workers are still not organised, it is challenging for them to demand their rights. Furthermore, official documents and accountability are mismanaged.",
      "6.	External & Systemic Weaknesses ",
      "Given the expanding budget and falling tax-to-GDP ratio, inadequate funding creates doubt about the scheme's long-term sustainability. The program is susceptible to economic downturns and budget cuts. Project quality and employee well-being are negatively impacted by political interference and cut money strategies. Areas affected by the Maoist insurgency are performing poorly and creating fewer jobs. The program's heavy reliance on manual labour limits its capacity to emphasise productivity and skill development. Modernisation in agriculture and industry may lead to a decrease in the need for manual labour. Work availability is impacted by inadequate or postponed budget allocation. Caste relations and social hierarchies have an impact on marginalised communities and the distribution of work. The integrity of the program can be completely jeopardised by political interference. A lack of awareness among local officials, insufficient administrative capacity, and bureaucratic red tape are among the problems."

    abstract: ["The changing India in international economic governance portrays a shift of a strategic refocus, which includes a switch from a normative idealism to a pragmatic geoeconomic statecraft. Historically, India has been regarded as a policy-taker to the multilateral organizations, (owing partly to its post-colonial economic vulnerabilities and identification with the Global South), and its hesitant attitude towards liberalization and global rule-setting was evident during its initial cooperation with the BWIs as well as the Non-Aligned Movement. But after the economic reforms of 1991 and the structural adjustments which were imposed throughout the politics of the IMF, India started settling down in the global economy with more assertiveness. In this regard, India has been moving towards re-branding itself as a rule-maker in multilateral forums, be it the G20 or BRICS much less new coalitions like the Quad and IPEF today, as the fifth-largest economy in the global sentencing.",
      "In this paper, the author follows the history of India as a participant in the nexus of global economic governance and evaluates critically their novice geoeconomic instrumentation, such as the introduction of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) like Aadhaar and UPI, development diplomacy through official development assistance and training capabilities like ITEC, and soft power of culture like the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). It appraises how India uses such tools to cultivate strategic leverage, a digital and development-shaped global phenomenon, and campaign agentry change in multilateral establishments that are structurally inclined to the Global North. Simultaneously, the paper questions the domestic constraints in India like regulatory unpredictability, internal economic disparity and policy vulnerability that hamper the Indian multilateral effectiveness.",
      "The paper helps in the understanding about how the emerging powers negotiate global governance, in the sense that by analyzing the phenomena of the India moving out of the reactive participation to the proactive agenda-setting. The alternative, inclusive and development-oriented multilateralism of an ever-more multipolar world order is possible through the model of India with its strategic autonomy, South-South solidarity, and institutional pluralism.",

          "India's developed role in global economic rule should be understood through its historical trajectory-from its vigilant engagement with post-World War institutions to becoming a major voice in emerging multilateral groups. In the decades after independence, India adopted a socialist, inward economic model. This Nehru vision-shaped developmental path emphasized the state-led industrialization and import replacement, India was kept relatively to the capitalist world economy and Bretton Woods institutions (Chatterjee, 2011). ",
          "During the Cold War, India aligned themselves with a group of non-aligned movement (NAM) and G7 to give voice to global South concerns. Instead of being an active partner in multilateral economic rules, India often adopted a moralist and defensive stance, which emphasizes sovereignty and equity on liberalization (Murthy, 2020). This reinforced its image as a policy-taking, which often reacts to global economic development rather than shaping them.",
          "There was a turn in 1991, when India faced a serious balance of payment crisis and introduced structural economic reforms under IMF guidance. These liberalization policies opened India into global markets, which change their views for multilateral engagement. India gradually shifted to creative participation in institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank. It started actively negotiating on trade rules, intellectual property rights and investment structure.",
          "This shift from being a rule-taker to a rule-shaper underscores India's desire not only for greater voice and representation but also for a more democratic, inclusive, and development-oriented global economic system.

India has invested in railways, education, and water systems in Africa, South Asia, and Indo-Pacific through Lines of Credit and grants-in-aid, and this has made it an important development partner (Prabhu, 2023).",
          "India has a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) infrastructure such as Aadhaar, UPI, and MOSIP that form another important pillar of Indian soft power. These open-source tools have been used to recreate the concept of digital governing and service delivery to people, which is now being employed by other nations including Morocco, Ethiopia, and the Philippines (Sarma, 2023). In 2023, India was the president of the G20 club and stated that DPI is a global public good, endorsed by IMF, World Bank, and UN as beneficial in terms of inclusiveness, innovation, and SDG acceleration with the involvement of civil society (Sarma, 2023).",
          "The role of cultural diplomacy in India is growing stronger and it is having an increase in soft power thanks to organizations like ICCR. Traditional programmes that cater to yoga and classical arts and programmes encouraging the use of Indian languages are being coupled with efforts at the Global Gen Next Buddhist Leaders Network, sponsorship of Indologists around the world (Rajya Sabha, 2021; 2023). This is how India has been able to blur the present and create a perception about her in the global world through a fusion of tradition and strategy.",
          "During the NITI Aayog summit of 2025 on Viksit Bharat @2047, it was realized that India had to lead in trade, renewable energy, digital regulation and legal reforms to compete globally and build multilateral engagements (PIB, 2025). The geoeconomic twist that India just took based on technology, development diplomacy, and cultural capital is, in effect, an alternative global system that is founded on cooperation, inclusivity, and resilience."

          "India, as a rising power, seeks to reshape global governance to align with its evolving aspirations.

However, this rise has not been without critiques. India champions Global South solidarity yet often aligns with developed nations on issues like intellectual property rights or trade liberalization. India often lacks domestic consensus on key reforms needed to back its multilateral positions (e.g., agricultural subsidies, investment liberalization). India has become more protectionist in trade, especially after 2014, which contrasts with its earlier role as a champion of liberalization with the Withdrawal from RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) is cited as evidence of a retreat from economic integration. . India’s active role in G20 discussions on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been significant, particularly in areas such as poverty reduction, education, and health.   India, despite being one of the largest economies, lacks proportional representation in Bretton Woods institutions (IMF, World Bank) and WTO decision-making processes for e.g.- Voting rights in the IMF are still skewed in favor of the US and EU, limiting India's influence.  India's slow bureaucratic processes, policy uncertainty, and frequent regulatory changes limit its ability to negotiate effectively in multilateral forums. Domestic politics often shape trade and economic policies to favour short-term populism over long-term global integration.  As a developing economy, India must balance multilateral obligations with domestic development needs like poverty alleviation, infrastructure, and food security. It often seeks special and differential treatment (S&DT) at WTO, which sometimes clashes with developed economies.",
          "The success of India’s financial inclusion programs, as discussed by Suresh et al. (2017) [25] , could serve as a model for other developing nations, particularly those looking to reduce poverty through improved access to banking services. Moreover, India's leadership in digital trade infrastructure development has implications for future global trade policies, particularly as the world moves towards more digitized economies. India's leadership in the International Solar Alliance demonstrates the potential for global cooperation on climate issues, with India playing a leading role in this transition. India aims to secure greater representation and voting rights in organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. India is positioning itself as the voice of the Global South, advocating for more inclusive, development-centric economic policies. To strengthen its position further, India should focus on expanding its leadership in digital trade and cybersecurity, areas of growing importance in global economic governance. Additionally, continuing to advocate for the interests of developing countries will help India maintain its influence in the world.  "

      "The rise to an agenda-setter in multilateral economic governance is an illustration of the rising economic power, technological prowess, and diplomatic boldness of India. Examples of such initiatives include development partnerships in Africa, digital diplomacy with the India Stack, and cultural outreach with the ICCR, which is a form of strategic influence that is based on inclusivity, sovereignty, and South cooperation. But, this transition does not come without limitations. India is still struggling with the problem of inconsistency in its domestic policymaking, underrepresentation in major multilateral institutions, and more general geopolitical limitations on its global ambitions. In the future, the capacity of India to balance national development interests against international obligations will be key to its durability. Due to the tendency of the international system to become more fragmented and multipolar, the geoeconomic statecraft of India presents an attractive model of re-imagining global governance, which is development-centric, digitally empowered, and built upon equitable multilateralism."

    title: "India's Approach to Crisis Diplomacy: Influential Mediator, Strategic Middle Power, or Global Impersonator?",
    author: "Annesha Gupta",
    authorAbbrev: "A.Gupta",
    abstract: [
      "At the turn of the 21st century, the post-Cold War unipolar period, dominated by the United States, has steadily given way to a multipolar international order, where emerging powers are increasingly influencing global governance. According to a 2024 report, over 61% of countries now perceive the world to be multipolar rather than just U.S.-led, a significant increase from 47% in 2018 (Leonard & Shapiro, 2024), signaling a growing dispersion of power. In this evolving geopolitical landscape, India has positioned itself as a rising global actor backed by its status as the largest democracy, the fifth largest economy, and the country with the largest population in the world. This paper examines India’s approach to crisis diplomacy through three major international conflicts discussed in the form of case studies, namely, the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the Israel-Palestine conflict, to critically assess the nature of India’s influence in global affairs. Drawing from the conceptual debates surrounding middle powers and emerging powers, the paper interrogates whether India acts as an influential mediator, a power of strategic balance, or a mere global impersonator. The case studies reveal a pattern of strategic ambivalence guided more by the need to minimise the negative impacts of a crisis on it than normative consistency. While India aspires to shape global outcomes, its diplomatic style frequently reflects an indecisive behavior and skittish positioning, rather than true leadership. The paper concludes by asserting that unless India bridges the credibility gap existing between its domestic self-perception and its actual diplomatic behavior, its aspirations to lead in a multipolar world may remain just a dream rather than become a reality.",

    intro: [
      "At the turn of the 21st century, given the increasing multipolarity of the world marked by frequent political, humanitarian, and security crises, the role of emerging powers in crisis diplomacy has come under growing scrutiny in the international forum. India, with its strategic location, rising economic ascendency, and normative aspirations, often projects itself as a responsible global stakeholder advocating for peace and stability and is therefore considered to be an important actor when it comes to crisis diplomacy. Broadly speaking, crisis diplomacy refers to the diplomatic efforts and strategies employed by countries to manage and resolve international crises. These crises can take many forms, such as armed conflicts, natural disasters, economic crises, and public health emergencies, and the diplomatic efforts may include negotiation, mediation, and peacekeeping operations. Despite the various nuances exhibited by the term, in the context of this paper, crisis diplomacy refers to the style of diplomacy employed by a country to handle situations of inter- and intra-state conflicts in the international arena that have become the focal point of public discourse for the overwhelming impact that they have had on global actors. The paper, through the comparative analysis of several case studies, seeks to offer a clear evaluative lens for understanding India’s foreign policy in the current scenario and tries to answer the question- whether this style of diplomacy is successful in meeting the interests of the country and genuinely influences outcomes in the international forum, or is it but a veiled attempt at hiding the weakening bargaining power of the state.

        heading: "India’s Diplomatic Leverage and the Middle Power Question ",
        paragraphs: [
          "Despite some contextual ambiguities, it is widely accepted that a middle power is a state that is not a superpower or a great power, but still exerts influence and plays a significant role in international relations. These countries often possess certain capabilities, such as strong economies, advanced technologies, and diplomatic influence, that allow them to have a voice in global affairs. Given that words like “middle,” “great”, and “small” generally signify the presence of a spectrum rather than something discrete, there’s a lot of discourse regarding what makes an international actor a “middle power”. In recent years, India has increasingly outgrown the constraints of being labeled a ‘middle power’. As one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, coupled with its strategic geographic position in South Asia, India is on the trajectory to become an ‘emerging great power’. This transformation distinguishes it from other traditionally classified middle powers such as Brazil, Germany, and South Africa. India’s ambitions are reflected in its comprehensive approach of economic reforms and military modernization, signaling its intent to play a more influential role on the global stage.  Moreover, India’s engagement in international groupings such as the QUAD, BRICS, and G4 plays a crucial part in its global strategy. These alliances serve distinct purposes; the QUAD, for instance, provides India with a platform to counterbalance China’s regional ambitions. ",
          "Meanwhile, BRICS aligns with India’s goals of reforming global governance structures to reflect contemporary economic realities. Through these alliances, India not only asserts its autonomy but also amplifies its influence in international decision-making. India’s soft power and cultural relevance act as another key leverage- the country has the largest overseas diaspora (32+ million people), contributing to economic and political influence. Therefore, despite the structural limitations faced by the country, most of which are recognized to be a legacy of the extensive history of colonial rule, such as poverty and socio-economic inequality, most global actors are of the opinion that the traditional label of middle power fails to capture India’s growing status. Courtesy of the balanced approach successfully adopted toward the great powers, its neighbors in South Asia, players in the extended neighborhood, and other Global South countries, in the current scenario, India might be closer to what is referred to as an “emerging power” than a “middle power”. Despite aligning with the fundamental characteristic of an emerging power, that is, being an emerging economy, some have argued the efficacy of classifying India as one, on the basis of ambiguity related to the actual influence that it has on the world. While sixty-eight percent of Indian adults believe that India’s influence has risen in the world, only a median of 28% adults across 19 other countries in the world think so (Pew Research Center, 2023). This perception gap highlights a disconnect between India’s self-image and how the world perceives its actual diplomatic impact. Domestic narratives, government communication, and media in India tend to promote a “soft power inflation”, emphasising India’s growing stature through G20 presidency, vaccine diplomacy, et cetera; however, this image so propagated is not fully convincing to external observers.",
          "Nevertheless, as per majoritarian consensus, India in the 21st century is, in fact, a rising power given the influence that it exhibits on the international forum, irrespective of whether the magnitude of it is inflated or not. Analyzing India's actions in high-stakes international crises is crucial to comprehending how its perceived diplomatic status translates into practical action. Although conceptual discussions tend to focus exclusively on India's goals and resources, they do not by themselves indicate whether India actually exerts influence or merely projects it. We can examine how far India has progressed from performative diplomacy to becoming a significant player on the international scene by analyzing its actions in particular geopolitical hotspots. The following case studies evaluate India's role by analyzing its diplomatic response to various international crises."

        paragraphs: [
          "The Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 disrupted two decades of India’s carefully cultivated ties with the elected Afghan republic. Long regarded by India as a proxy of Pakistan’s security establishment and a patron of anti-India terrorist networks, the Taliban presents a unique strategic challenge that involves navigating this engagement without undermining its principles or compromising its security. India’s immediate response to the takeover was characterized by caution, and the government took a pragmatic approach, opting not to immediately engage with the Taliban but keeping diplomatic channels open through multilateral platforms such as the UN and the SCO. India’s approach appeared to be reactive as it shut down its Kabul embassy in August 2021, initiated a rescue operation, and limited its interactions with the Taliban to the delivery of aid. Stationing a “technical team” in Kabul was one of the first public steps that the Indian government took towards engaging with the Taliban. While the U.S. and other Western powers condemned the Taliban’s actions, India was wary of openly criticizing the group in a way that could undermine its regional influence. India’s policy emphasized the need for an inclusive government in Afghanistan that would represent all ethnic and political groups, including the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras, while ensuring that the Taliban respected the rights of women and minorities. However, the country gave the Taliban leadership the de facto legitimacy it has sought from the international community since its return to power when its top diplomat Vikram Misri met Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai - the highest level of engagement since Kabul's fall.",
          "Afghanistan has always been a critical space for India’s strategic outreach in Central Asia, and the Taliban’s resurgence has complicated these efforts. India’s interests in Afghanistan extend beyond political influence; it also seeks access to Central Asia’s energy resources and trade routes. The re-establishment of a Taliban regime creates a challenge for India’s access to these resources, particularly given the Taliban’s ties with Pakistan and China. The Taliban’s return to power could lead to an increase in cross-border terrorism, particularly from groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which have historically had safe havens in Afghanistan. Thus, India’s cautious approach in engaging the Taliban could be justified given its twin related concerns about security threats emerging from Afghanistan and the Taliban regime’s relationship with Pakistan. What is harder to rationalize is the documented shortcomings of the Indian government in its treatment of Afghan citizens since the Taliban’s takeover. These issues include problems around visa issuance, renewal of visas for Afghan students in India, challenges faced by Afghan citizens currently in India, and the uncertainty faced by Afghan refugees in India. Although some might interpret India’s response to the takeover as the country’s ever-increasing dedication to making peace with the geopolitical realities of the world, there is no doubt that this demonstrates the limits of India’s crisis diplomacy in a volatile neighborhood.",

        paragraphs: [
          "India’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been distinctive among the major democracies and U.S. strategic partners. Despite its discomfort with Russia’s aggression, India has adopted a studied public neutrality toward Russia. It has abstained from successive votes in the UN Security Council, General Assembly, and Human Rights Council that condemned Russian aggression in Ukraine and, thus far, has refused to openly call out Russia as the instigator of the crisis. Its declared positions were intended to convey, more subtly than is justified, its dismay with Russian actions without taking a proper stand. Thus, India urged “respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states,” called “for the immediate cessation of violence and hostilities,” regretted “that the path of diplomacy was given up” and urged the concerned states to “return to it,” and reiterated that “dialogue is the only answer to settling differences and disputes, however daunting that may appear at this moment.” ",
          " For the United States, India’s neutrality has been disappointing because it signaled a sharp divergence between the U.S. and India on a fundamental issue of global order, namely, the legitimacy of using force to change borders and occupy another nation’s territory through a blatant war of conquest. Whatever their views on the genesis and the precipitants of the Ukraine war, most Indian strategic elites would admit that their country’s diplomatic neutrality ultimately signifies what one Indian scholar has called “a subtle pro-Moscow position.” This seems particularly incongruous today because India stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States in opposing Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific while at the same time appearing tolerant of the vastly more egregious Russian belligerence in Europe.",
          "India’s tightrope walk on the Ukraine war has been described as “strategic ambivalence.” Expressing the country’s interest in peacebuilding efforts, Narendra Modi has met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on multiple occasions. As part of its humanitarian response, India sent medical supplies, equipment, and relief materials to Ukraine, while at the same time, it has significantly increased its imports of discounted Russian oil since the conflict began. In this context, the weak efforts made by the country in support of Ukraine, such as pushing to open the Black Sea Grain Corridor, can be deduced to attempts aimed at hiding its informed inability to take a stand with the thin veil of “neutrality”. After all, alienating Russia is not an option for India, given the central role the former plays in the latter’s security concerns against China and Pakistan. Moreover, the country’s military, economy, and energy sector are overwhelmingly dependent on Russia, to the extent that any act of outright antagonism poses the threat of destabilising the country’s internal machinery. Thus, the decision to steer clear of publicly condemning Russia is shaped not by abstract concerns about the integrity of the world order but by strategic geopolitical considerations."

        paragraphs: [
          "The Israel-Palestine conflict, the origins of which go back more than a century, once again found a point of eruption on 7th October, 2023 when the Hamas and several other Palestinian militant groups launched coordinated armed incursions from the Gaza Strip into the Gaza envelope of southern Israel, the first large-scale invasion of Israeli territory since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In light of this situation, the Indian government had condemned terrorism in the strongest language and stood with Israel over the attack, while calling on Israel for restraint, dialogue, and diplomacy, condemning the death of civilians, and calling for “humanitarian pauses” in bombardment. At the same time, India has reaffirmed its support for a “two-state solution” including a sovereign, viable state of Palestine existing in peace alongside Israel and supported the “socio-economic welfare” of the Palestinian people. However, as the conflict has progressed, at least 60,332 people, including at least 17,400 children, have been killed as of July 29, 2025, according to the reports of the Gaza Ministry of Health.",
          "Historically speaking, India’s stance on the Israel-Palestine issue has been nothing short of inconsistent. In 1977, India was among the first non-Arab nations to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and has since consistently supported a two-state solution. However, its diplomatic stance on the current war in Gaza has not aligned with this position, and domestically, authorities have shown little tolerance for pro-Palestine activism.",
          "Indian diplomacy has taken to knowingly maintain a layer of ambiguity regarding its actual stand, propagated by its policy of “abstention”, which has been the default vote of India on every UN resolution decrying the horrors of the ongoing crisis taking place in Gaza. The Permanent Representative (PR) to the UN has expressed the country’s “unwavering support” to the “Palestinian cause” in the UN Security Council, yet it refuses to hold anyone responsible. This has once again exposed the tension between India’s moral commitments and strategic alignments, given that India buys about $2 billion worth of arms from Israel every year, making up over 30 percent of Israel’s total exports of armaments. Moreover, the Indian public opinion views the current conflict through the lens of counterterrorism, and it views the Israeli assault on Gaza as a counterterrorism operation- and counterterrorism operations don’t pause for humanitarian truces. The main question, however, remains whether India can maintain credibility as a responsible global actor while remaining diplomatically ambiguous in humanitarian crises."

    ],
    conclusion: [
      "In the evolving global order marked by heightened crises, India stands at a crossroads. As multipolarity becomes entrenched and expectations rise for middle and emerging powers to play constructive roles, India's crisis diplomacy will come under increasing international scrutiny. If India aspires to be seen as more than a swing state or a selective responder, it must articulate clearer foreign policy doctrines on humanitarian and geopolitical emergencies backed by timely and decisive action. While the country continues to assert itself as a responsible actor committed to peace, its conduct across key geopolitical arenas such as Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Gaza demonstrates a recurring pattern of strategic caution, ambiguous action, and situational inability to act on key matters. The domestic majoritarian public opinion regarding the country’s style of diplomacy in recent years seems to be uninformed at best and hypocritical at worst. The same crowd that views the country’s thawing relationship with the Taliban through the lens of realism is the same crowd that would defend India’s silent pro-Russian position in the Ukraine-Russia war based on some misguided notion of “historic ties” and “loyalty”. However, what they fail to recognize is that India’s stand of “strategic ambivalence” is not something that is hand-crafted; rather, it is something that the country has no choice but to follow, given the magnitude of its dependence on countries like Russia and Israel. While the freedom from the compulsion to align is something that the country has fought for since its Non-Alignment days, it is doubtful whether any self-righteous entity has the moral right to not take a stance in the face of human rights violations, breaches of sovereignty, or humanitarian catastrophes.",
      "India's approach to crisis diplomacy is typical of a state negotiating its transitional status: it is no longer classified as a traditional middle power but is also not yet politically or materially prepared to act as an independent global influencer, at least when it comes to issues that do not directly involve it. Whether India can overcome its present constraints and adopt a more assertive and cohesive diplomatic persona will rely on its readiness to go beyond hedging, cultivate issue-based leadership, and exhibit coherence between its principles and its conduct."

    abstract: [
      "Geoeconomics has always been inextricably linked to the battle for world power, by the very definition of leveraging economic tools strategically for geopolitical purposes. As the international order realigned and ended military confrontation in the traditional sense, states have increasingly deployed tools such as trade policy, foreign investment, sanctions and control over supply chains to shape and safeguard their national interests. China consequently became a key actor in this dynamic, transforming U.S. strategy and accelerating globalization’s balkanization. Diplomacy, regional positioning, national security strategies — all these are impacted by geoeconomics. This paper tackles the ascendance of geoeconomic statecraft, its working today, and weaponized interdependence and its consequences. It examines how great powers adapt to this shifting landscape while constructively confronting the danger of economic coercion overreach, the consequences of strategic decoupling, and the normative imperative for state relations in tomorrow’s multipolar world.",

    intro: [
      " The current order of the world in the 21st century is not characterized by conventional military confrontations; rather, it is dominated of economic rivalry and strategic maneuvers through markets, or geoeconomics. Unlike geopolitics which is focused on the physical territory and military force, geoeconomics is concerned with the use of economic might in trade, investment, finance and technology in order to influence the conduct of states and other entities. This trend marks a crucial shift in the nature of power in a globalized context where the capacity to influence economic frameworks and supply networks leads to determining the geopolitical outcomes. The rapid rise of China, particularly with the BRI, has transformed American economic statecraft; it has accelerated the undermining of US economic hegemony and accelerated the fragmentation of global markets. In turn, the US has adopted a more sophisticated approach to maintaining its strategic edge—export controls on critical technology and sanctions. This is one American example where diplomacy, alliance-building, and national security have been shaped by geoeconomics.  The increasing interconnectedness of the global economy, once considered a force that calms tensions, now stands out as a potential weakness as it enables the world’s strongest powers to view inter-state economic entanglement as a means to exert influence.This paper focuses on the rise of geoeconomics in the global geopolitical contest and the instruments deployed.

          "In the 1990s, the term geoeconomics was coined by Edward Luttwak, who foresees a changing paradigm: from military confrontation to economic competition as the platform for state rivalry. Initially a conceptual plane, geoeconomics became an applied plane with the growth of globalization and states' realization of economic leverage. Post-Cold War liberalism promoted open markets and global economic integration as forces of peace and prosperity. China poses a challenge to this paradigm and so do the resurgence of Russia and volatile U.S. policies. Never before have economic levers been so weaponized, warranted perhaps, from sanctions, tariffs, screening of investment to infrastructure diplomacy.  A recent U.S.-China rivalry presents the BRI from a better view in concrete geoeconomic competition. BRI, inaugurated in 2013, shows very heavy investment in connectivity and infrastructure all over Asia, Africa, and Europe that create economic dependency, which translates into political power. In response, the U.S. has stepped up export controls.",

The U.S.-China trade confrontation highlighted the possibility of wielding tariffs as a tool of national protectionism on the one hand and a tool to shape the geopolitical outlook of competitor nations on the other.",

They isolate the given country from an array of things like payment global systems, freezing of assets, and various economic activities. Since the U.S. dollar is the main world reserve currency, U.S. sanctions are more effective than those of other countries. Some organizations, such as SWIFT, direct the money flows, and this determines who follows the protocols and rules and who does not.",

A perfect example is if one country controls major things like monetary centers, data harbors, or vital supply chains register, it can come in very good stalling for other countries who would be forced to pay a price or pushovers. This creates problems. For example, the imposition of sanctions on Iran and Russia, whose economies are mostly based on the use of the dollar system, appears to be very detrimental to them. Moreover, the issues with the computer chip supply line demonstrate how depending on technology can be a sort of insecurity towards national defense. This geoeconomic rivalry is also prompting nations to minimize their interconnections with other countries. They want to shift the manufacturing facilities back into their home country or find suppliers who are based elsewhere. The improvement increases competitiveness; however, it usually results in a reduction of the global market, an increase in costs, and a possibility for the breakup of the international economic system.",

      "Geoeconomics has changed how power shows on the world stage—from old wars with guns to sly fights with cash moves. Nations now use trade deals, bans, cash plans, and tech rules to gain what they want, which makes world ties much trickier & tense. Take the US & China, for example—their tug-of-war shows how much cash strength can shift talks, friends, & safety issues. But here’s the deal: pushing too hard with cash might make gaps, less equality, & even chaos. So, if the world aims to stay calm, we need a mix of fight & work-together—and clear rules for using cash power well. Really, the whole future of our world system hangs on finding this good spot."

      "The rural area of India differs a lot from urban in context of social and economic aspect. The access to resources varies a lot in rural part and this is historical in nature. The marginalized communities have been struggling in both social and economic space to bring equality. The existing inequalities in the rural area creates barrier for the development of whole country. Many efforts from the government have been taken to address those inequalities. Both social and economic status are very much inter-related to each other and the adversities of marginalized people exacerbate at the intersection of case, class and gender. The different government policies intended to uplift economic and social status of marginalized communities. The livelihood programs are implemented which attempt to enhance the income and reduce the social inequalities. This article explores the impact and challenges of implementing livelihood programs to reduce socio-economic inequalities in rural India. Two of the major interventions of government are kept in focus to analyze the impact. The two interventions are Mahatma Gandhi NREGS and DAY-NRLM. The planning and execution need a more grounded approach to reduce the socio-economic inequalities.",

      " Before the British rule and advent of capitalism, the production center was decentralized and an ecosystem was established. But it was based on inequalities of caste, gender and class. After British arrival, the trade, agriculture and infrastructure saw a shift and it promoted feudalism. The railway promoted inter location trade. Zamindari Pratha broke the backbone of farmers. Also, the traders were impacted by British monopoly on trade. The local crafts also got setback. The British policy created an imbalance and increased the gap of economic inequality. The social dimension was already engrossed in wide inequality before British arrival. The four-caste division was putting the lower ordered cast in deep lack of resources. The land division was in favor of general caste. The discrimination put another burden on Dalit and tribals. Its ripple effect can be seen till today. The economic, social and cultural capital of Dalit and tribal was in lowest order. The condition of woman was even poor where gender discrimination and patriarchy was hinderance in social and economic growth of women. ",
      "After independence, numerous efforts were taken to reduce the inequality in rural areas. Some of the major interventions were affirmative action, land reform, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and PDS (public distribution system). Along with this, the intervention to boost rural socio-economic status were- Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna Gramin, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna, DAY-NRLM, Jan Dhan Yojna,Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojna, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi yojana. All these schemes have certainly improved the socio-economic condition in rural India. But the inequality gap still persists at the intersection of caste, class and gender. Dalit and tribal are still struggling to claim equality in social domain. The economic condition of rural India is still not accelerating faster, where livelihood opportunity is still limited and subject to climate change. This article will delve into the impact analysis of major intervention by government on socio-economic inequalities of rural India."

There are some similar patterns in rural area and also some distinct pattern of any particular region based on the geographical and cultural uniqueness. The inequalities are created by both social and economic status and they are interrelated to each other. The poor household lack resources in terms of capital, land and education. Many times, poverty is intergenerational which vary at the intersection of caste class and gender in the society. Majority of marginalized group belonging to SCs and STs, minority and people engaged in low productivity occupation. Limited skill restricts the occupational mobility in rural area. The lack of resources also hinders them to upgrade their status and skill by trainings. There is lack of access to credit and market by poor. Due to this, people in rural area find difficult to get the price of their commodities. And, lack of credit restricts to invest in agriculture or livestock or any entrepreneurial activities. There is lack of proper institution platform in rural area to address their poverty and find any options to overcome it. The poverty cycle becomes like a trap from which it is very difficult to come outside. When it comes to government services, the structure at grassroot level is not that much efficient. Here also, people in rural area faces challenges due to lack of awareness and connectivity. In case of borrowing from informal sources in case of urgent need, it cost them a lot. Small holder farmer faces lot of challenges in terms of forward and backward linkages.  The social challenges come in form of discrimination and exclusion from mainstream. The cast, class and gender norms become so strong that it creates another level of barrier that promotes inequality."

These access to capital has enhanced the confidence and provided many options to start as new activities to increase their income. The capital also strengthened their existing livelihood activities. More than 2.64 crore household have Agri-Nutri Garden. This nutrition garden has an important role in access to better health and proper nutrition in villages. This initiative also reduced their dependency on outside for getting vegetables and thus helped in saving. Around 36,205 custom hiring centers established to help small and marginal farmers hire farm tools and services at a nominal cost. This has supported in mechanization of agriculture in rural area to enhance the efficiency and production. Nearly 3.13 lakh enterprises are in 280 blocks of 31 states/UT under Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Program (SVEP).  ",

Also, lack of water facility and toilet near meeting place possess challenges. Although, there is rising in number of SHG in India, but there is lack of family support to many women which proves to be blockage in mobility. Going to market place, block or district is still a challenge for many women due to lack of societal and family level support. The women collectives are engaging in value chain of commodities but marketing challenges are in front of them in the form of better connectivity to market, branding of their produce and domination by big traders. The loan repayment delays cases weaken the SHG and motivation of women to work together. There are also cases of in which SHG stop their meeting due to many hurdles and challenges that remain unaddressed.

It has convergence with many other government departments also but still the marginal farmers are struggling to enhance their income. There is huge migration due to this. For this, different framework needs to be brought up which can tackle this issue. There can also be an initiative to make a larger federation of women at district or state level which can address the socio-economic inequalities in rural parts of the country. The larger voice can be helpful in advocacy and policy framing. The convergence at ground level needs more monitoring.

The rural base of economy is majorly dependent on agriculture and other informal sectors. The economic upliftment of marginalized communities is helping them to do better in education and health parameters also. The improvement is seen by many of the schemes that are implemented in rural area.

      "The socio-economic inequalities existing in rural India is historical and has a lot of impact on marginalized communities. The development of country cannot be visioned without keeping rural India in focus. There have been several initiatives by government of India to reduce it. Ther has been progress made around it. Mahatma Gandhi and DAY-NRLM are important initiatives by government. Both has contributed in upliftment of SCs, STs and women of rural India. There are challenges at ground level which needs very special attention and intensive engagement. The role of women collectives has great role in empowerment of women at social and economic level. The role of women collective can be further increased and intensified in rural area. There is still a long path to go for achieving just and equitable society in rural parts of India."

      "This research paper explores whether the Make in India policy initiated by the government of India in 2014 to boost domestic manufacturing has had an impact on green product adoption among Indian consumers. Using a mixed method approach, this study evaluates quantitative survey data and qualitative interviews to examine how consumers respond to green products under influence of national policy. Additionally, the paper includes a case study on FabIndia, a brand for sustainable practices and strong alignment with national identity, drawing on the Stimulus Organism Response (S-O-R) model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The findings suggest that although there is a rising awareness and positive perception of green products, significant barriers such as affordability, limited axis and scepticism continue to hinder widespread adoption. The paper concludes with targeted policy recommendations to bridge this gap.",

    intro: [
      " The global environment crisis brought unprecedented attention to sustainable consumption and production patterns. In this context, public policy is increasingly recognised not just as a tool for industrial development but also as an enabler of sustainable behaviour among consumers in India. The Make in India initiative represents one of the largest industrial and economic policies aimed at transforming the country into a global manufacturing hub launched in 2014. Make in India has been instrumental in attracting foreign investments, fostering innovations and building best in class manufacturing infrastructure. However, its potential to influence environmentally sustainable consumer behaviour remains largely unexplored. ",
      "India’s rising middle class, coupled with the growing environmental awareness represents an opportunity to align industrial policies with ecological goals, sustainable development goal 12 which emphasises responsible consumption and production, and provides the broader global framework within which India’s policies can be evaluated by Make in India focus on increasing domestic production capabilities. The alignment of this growth with ecological sustainability must be interrogated. ",
      "The present research aims to assess whether Make in India plays a role in promoting green product adoption among Indian consumers. Green products are characterised by minimal environmental impact, eco-friendly production process and ethical labour practices are increasingly entering the Indian market. However, consumer adoption of such products remains uneven and highly stratified by socio- economic status. ",
      "This study employs the vertical framework Stimulus Organism Response (SOR) model and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The Make in India initiative functions as a stimulus that potentially affects consumer adopted consumer attitudes ( organism ) which in turn influences green product purchases (responses). TPB is used to understand the roles of attitudes, social norms and perceived behaviour control in shaping social eco-conscious consumption. ",
      "FabIndia, a retail brand known for its eco-conscious practices and traditional Indian identity serves as the case study with its roots in rural craftsman and environmentally responsible production. FabIndia embodies the intersection of sustainability, culture and policy branding through its alignment with national identity and ethical sourcing. The brand offers a unique lens to examine how industrial policy can indirectly shape consumer behaviour."

        paragraphs: [
          "Understanding green consumerism in India requires a contextual and conceptual exploration of both evaluation of sustainable development in policy and the consumer's role in environmental change. The green consumer movement, which began in the West during the 1970s in response to environmental degradation, found resonance in India much later, gaining traction in the early 2000s as awareness around climate change and ecological footprint intensified. The Make in India policy, although primarily aimed at economic transformation, provides a unique policy context to assess consumer responsiveness to environmentally sustainable choices",
          "Make in India was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2014 with the goal of increasing domestic manufacturing and reducing import dependency. Its emphasis on innovation, investment, skill development and infrastructure made it a comprehensive policy tool for economic growth. However, the environmental dimension of this policy was not explicitly prioritised in its early years. Only over time, through the integration of sustainability in the production processes and certification, did the policy begin to intersect with eco-conscious narratives.",
          "From a policy perspective, India’s commitment to the Paris agreement and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) acts as a guiding framework for integrating sustainability into all domains, including consumer behaviour. SDG 12, in particular, calls for responsible consumption and production partners, making it a relevant lens through which to analyse the Make in India initiative. Government programmes such as “Zero Defect Zero Effect” and ZED certificate (part of the Make in India camping) attempt to balance productivity with environmental stewardship, but their visibility and impact at consumer levels remain limited. ",
          "The academic literature on green consumerism in India reflects a new understanding of its slow yet steady emergence (Gupta and Ogden, 2009), referring to the value-action gap where consumers who express environmental concerns do not consistently act upon them. They attribute this gap to several factors, including high prices, limited product availability, and mistrust in green claims. Similarly, Vermeir and Verbeke (2006) suggest that perceived consumer effectiveness—they believe that individual choices can make a difference—is crucial for motivating green purchasing. In India, however, where collective behaviour and affordability strongly influence decisions, this belief is underdeveloped.",
          "From a marketing perspective, Peattie and Crane (2005) criticise green marketing for being vague, misleading, and superficial, which can result in consumer scepticism. Ottman (2011) underscored the need for authentic and culturally resonant green branding, warning against superficial eco-labelling or greenwashing. She emphasises that trust, emotional connection, and alignment with personal value significantly influence green branding credibility.",
          "Country-of-origin effects also play a role in consumer behaviour. According to Verlegh and Steenkamp (1999), national identity influences consumer preferences and products that are domestic associated with higher trust, better quality or cultural appropriateness. This becomes particularly relevant in India where patriotism and self-reliance (“atmanirbharta”)  have increasingly shaped consumers' narratives post 2014. Hence, the Make in India label functions not only as a manufacturing tag but also a symbol of national resurgence. Brand level case studies provide further insights.",
          "FabIndia has emerged as a key player in India’s green retail sector by combining traditional craftsmanship with ethical and sustainable sourcing. Founded in 1960, the company works with over 55,000 artisans using natural ties, handloom fabric and locally sourced material materials. Its transparency, aesthetic appeal and emphasis on Indian heritage allow it to gain trust among a segment of conscious consumers. However, questions around affordability and accessibility remain, despite the theoretical and empirical richness in the literature. First and foremost, studies do not directly assess how public policy branding like Make in India shapes consumer decisions regarding green products. Second, the interplay between national identity, brand trust and sustainability is often discussed in isolation, not in an integrated manner. ",
          "Finally, there is limited research that combines behavioural frameworks like S-O-R and TPB with real life brand examples in Indian context in the background and literature review position. This study within an evolving but under-explored intersection of policy, branding and sustainable consumer behaviour by combining macro level policy analysis with micro consumer insights. This research aims to fill existing gaps and contribute to a more holistic understanding of green adoption in the Indian market."

        heading: "Theme 1-  Awareness of green initiatives under Make in India ",
        paragraphs: [
          "Understanding consumer awareness and perception of green products is essential to evaluating the effectiveness of Make in India policy promoting consumption. These themes delve into the cognitive, emotional and behavioural components of consumer engagement with green products with a focus on how policy landscape influences the perceptions, consumer awareness of green products in India is steadily increasing. Yet it remains fragmented and unevenly distributed across different demographics. Responses from urban and semi urban areas reveal that approximately 68% of consumers are familiar with the term “green products”, but only 34% could accurately identify products that meet recognised environmental standards. This knowledge gap suggests that while environmental consciousness is growing, it often looks deep and specific.  ",
          "A key finding from the study is the role of education and media in shaping green awareness. Respondents with high education level, especially those in postgraduate programmes or environmental studies, demonstrate great awareness and comprehension of green certification, sustainable sourcing and equilibrium media exposure particularly through social media campaigns and documentary content on platforms like YouTube and Netflix has also contributed to the rising interest in sustainable consumption. However, traditional media outlets like TV and newspaper remain limited, India promotes green narratives, often focusing instead on price and functionality.",
          "Awareness also varies by region and social economic classes. In Tier-1 cities like Delhi and Bengaluru, social eco-conscious is more visible due to access to green retail outlets, educational institutions and policy driven dialogues. In contrast, respondents from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities reported significantly lower exposure to sustainability campaigns or Make in India initiatives emphasising green innovation. This disparity underscores the urban-rural divide in sustainability outreach and reveals the need for more localised awareness strategies with respect to make in India policy. Consumer recognition of its linkage to sustainability is surprisingly limited while lower 70% of respondents were aware of the Make in India campaign; fewer than 30% associated it with sustainability or green manufacturing. This disconnect illustrates a significant communication gap in policy messaging the policies. ",
          "Branding is often associated with nationalism, employment and economic revival, but not with environmental responsibility. As a result, consumers fail to see their purchase of green products as behaviour aligned with policy initiatives. Emotional responses and attitudes also play a crucial role in shaping consumption patterns. Respondents expressed a generally favourable view of green products, citing themes such as ethicality, innovation, and alignment with nature. Many associated consumption with a sense of personal pride and moral superiority. Yet this perception does not always translate into actual purchasing behaviour due to the perceived barriers. The most commonly cited barriers were high cost (45%),  lack of availability (31%),  and doubts about authenticity (28%). ",
          "Interestingly, the perception of foreign versus domestic green brands reveals important insights into the effectiveness of Make in India initiative. While some consumers prefer international brands for their perceived superior quality and certification, others lean toward Indian-made products as a way to support local artisans and contribute to national growth. Groups often associate brands like FabIndia, Khadi India, and Forest essentials with ethical practices and cultural relevance, aligning well with the Make in India ethos.",
          "FabIndia emerges as a crucial brand in shaping perceptions around green consumption through its emphasis on artisanal production, sustainable fabrics and traditional Indian techniques. The Brand has successfully cultivated a strong identity associated with eco-friendliness and national pride. Several interviews describe FabIndia not just as a retail store but also as a lifestyle choice, reflecting a blend of cultural authenticity and ecological responsibility. This brand identity resonates strongly with young urban professionals and consumers who hold Gandhian value. ",
          "However, this positive perception is not universal. Several consumers pointed out that FabIndia's premium pricing excludes a significant portion of the population. Moreover, its urban Centre retail presence and limited digital marketing in vernacular languages, makes it less accessible to rural and regional consumers. As a result, while the brand enjoys high regard in niche urban circles, it falls short in achieving mass adoption to enhance consumer awareness. To shift consumer perceptions, the Make in India policy must be communicated more explicitly within sustainable narratives. This includes integrating green certification policies into promotions, subsidising environment-friendly local businesses and featuring consumer education in regional languages. Partnerships between the government and retail brands like FabIndia can amplify these messages and build consumer trust. ",
          "In conclusion, strategic alignment between sustainable branding and policy communication is essential to broaden the impact of green consumption in India. The Make in India policy has potential as a catalyst for sustainable consumption but requires clearer and more inclusive messaging. Perceptions of green products are generally positive but practical barriers continue to inhibit adoption. A strategic alignment of policy, communication, brand, collaboration, and educational outreach is necessary to bridge the gap between awareness and action."

          "Theme 2 - Influence of cultural Identity and Brand Trust in Green Adoption ",
          "This section explores how these cultural touchpoints interact with policy initiatives, like Make in India to shape consumer confidence and action. At the heart of this theme is the notion that consumer behaviour in India is not solely rational or utilitarian, it is also deeply emotional and symbolic. ",
          "The Make in India campaign itself is rooted in nationalist rhetoric that champions self-reliance, economic sovereignty and pride in Indian goods. This patriotic narrative appeals to a wide segment of the population that seeks to assert their identity through consumption. Within this framework, green products that are also locally produced gain an added layer of appeal by serving both ecological and cultural objectives. ",
          "India stands out as a leading example of how brand trust and cultural resonance can elevate green adoption. Established in 1960, FabIndia built its identity on the preservation of Indian handicraft, rural livelihood and natural material materials. It sources directly from artisans across India, ensuring that its products retain the authenticity of local traditions. Its use of handwoven textile, herbal skincare ingredients, and eco-friendly dyes reflects a green ethic embedded in Indian cultural practices. Survey responses and interviews reveal that consumers associate FabIndia with transparency, ethical sourcing and national pride. ",
          "Many urban Millennials and middle consumers remarked that purchasing from FabIndia gave them a sense of purpose. It allowed them to support rural economies, pressure, cultural heritage, and reduce their carbon footprint, all through a single act of consumption. This meaningful engagement contributes to high levels of brand trust and is a critical factor in green purchasing decisions. However, the brand success lies not only in its products but also in its storytelling. FabIndia’s marketing campaigns often highlight the artisans behind each product, the traditional techniques used, and the environmental responsibility embedded in each product. Transparency and storytelling bridge the gap between consumer values and purchasing behaviour, a common challenge encountered in green marketing. ",
          "The link between brand and Green adoption was further corroborated by the data. 61% of the survey participants indicated that they were more likely to buy green products from brands they trust, even if the price was slightly higher. Among those who mentioned FabIndia, nearly 80% said that the brand's reputation and authenticity influenced their willingness to make a purchase. This aligns with the existing literature that underscores the importance of brand reliability in influencing consumer participation in sustainable capitalism, especially when it comes to green claims. ",
          "Furthermore cultural familiarity also plays a role in reducing resistance to green consumption. Many respondents viewed FabIndia’s use of indigenous materials and traditional aesthetics as a “return to roots” and alternative to mass produced Western-style products. This cultural positioning also allows the brand to resonate with consumers across age groups and ideologies, from environmentally conscious youth to older generations nostalgic and pre-globalised India. Nonetheless, challenges persist. Several interviewees acknowledged that, while they trust FabIndia, its pricing often makes it inaccessible to lower-middle-class consumers. This economic barrier limits the scalability of trust-driven green adoption. ",
          "Moreover, in regions where cultural diversity is more complex, and awareness about brands like FabIndia is limited, the trust factor diminishes, leading to lower adoption rates. The implications for policy are significant. If Make in India is to genuinely promote clean consumption, it must engage with brands that embody Indian values and sustainability principles. Strategic collaboration between the government and culturally rooted brands like FabIndia could amplify outreach and reinforce policy objectives through trust intermediaries. Additionally, there is a need for sustained storytelling and awareness campaigns that show how green products are not only environmentally sound but also culturally authentic. In conclusion, cultural identity and trust are key drivers in green product adoption in India. FabIndia’s case illustrates that when green products are interwoven with narratives of heritage, self-reliance and ethical transparency, they gain emotional and symbolic significance. Leveraging these connections through the Make in India framework could unlock deeper and broader participation in the green economy."

        heading: "Theme 3 - Barriers to Green Product Adoption ",
        paragraphs: [
          "Despite increasing awareness and a generally favourable perception of green products, significant barriers continue to hinder widespread adoption among Indian consumers. This section dwells into the specific financial, structural and psychological obstacles that prevent the translation of positive attitude into actual consumer behaviour. While the Make in India initiative provides an overarching, economic and industrial framework, it has not fully addressed the grassroot-level barriers that affect sustainable consumption. ",
          "One of the most prominent barriers identified in the survey is affordability. More than 45% of the respondents cited high prices as the main reason they refrain from purchasing green products. Green goods, often perceived as a premium or niche, are priced significantly higher than conventional alternatives. This price difference is partly due to the higher cost of sustainable raw materials, ethical labour, and limited economies of scale. For consumers operating within tight budgets, particularly in semi urban and ruler areas, the cost factor becomes a decisive deterrent. Several interviews from middle-income households reported that while they support the idea of green consumption, they cannot consistently afford to make their environmental environmentally responsible choices. ",
          "Availability also emerged as a major constraint. Approximately 31% of the respondents said that the green products were not easily accessible in their local markets. Many green brands are concentrated in tier-1 cities, leaving consumers in tier-2 and tier-3 cities dependent on online shopping—which may not be always feasible due to digital illiteracy, poor logistics, or lack of trust in e-commerce platforms. Even when green alternatives are available, they are often limited in variety or poorly labelled, making it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions. ",
          "A third significant barrier is consumer scepticism or distrust regarding the authenticity of the green products. About 28% of the participants expressed doubt about the claims made by the brands. India’s market has seen rising greenwashing, where companies falsely advertise their products as eco-friendly to capitalise on consumer sentiment. This erodes trust and discourages repeat purchases. Consumers are increasingly demanding transparency, certification and clear communication about product and environmental impact. However, regulatory oversight of green labelling in India remains weak, exacerbating the problem. ",
          "Cultural inertia also plays a subtle but important role. In many households, particularly among the old generation, consumption patterns are deeply habitual. The idea of paying more for less convenient products that offer ecological benefit is not always embraced. Some interviews pointed out that older family members view green consumption as elitist and impractical. This generational divide complicates adoption within joint or conservative families. ",
          "Policy limitations represent another systematic challenge. While Make in India policy emphasises industrial growth and economic self-reliance, its sustainability narrative remains limited to invisibility. The policy does not significantly promote green consumer goods through subsidies, tax breaks or awareness campaigns. As a result, consumers do not connect the dots between national policy and individual purchasing choices. The lack of direct government incentives or retail-level support discourages both suppliers and buyers from entering or expanding in green market places. ",
          "Finally, the education system and media have not adequately filled the awareness action gap. While coverage of climate change and sustainability is increasing in the news, practical information about how to integrate green products into everyday life is scarce. Respondents who were supportive of green adoption often learned about it through word of mouth or international exposure, not through formal education or government outreach. This limits the reach and scale of sustainable practices. ",
          "To overcome these barriers a multifaceted strategy is required. First, government and private sector partnerships should work to reduce the cost of green goods through subsidies, increased domestic production and certification support. Second, regulatory bodies must enforce strict standards against greenwashing and encourage transparency. Third, regional distribution networks and media campaigns can help bridge the urban-ruler gap. Fourth, the Make in India policy should be more explicitly with green goals through branding incentives and localised outreach thereby aligning consumer behaviour with policy ambitions. ",
          "In conclusion, the barriers to green product adoption in India are real, multifaceted, and deeply embedded in social-economic structure. While awareness and interest are growing, they are not yet significant enough to overcome practical psychological resistance. Any effort to promote sustainable consumption through policies such as Make in India must directly address these barriers with structural, regulatory, and cultural interventions."

        paragraphs: [
          "Beyond the central themes of awareness, brand trust and structural barriers, this research uncovered several additional insights that offer a more nuanced understanding of green product adoption under the Make in India policy. These insights primarily through qualitative interviews, open-ended survey responses, and observations of behavioural patterns, not initially anticipated in the design of the study. Collectively, they contribute depth and contextual richness to the core findings. ",
          "One of the most striking revelations was the role of peer networks and community influence in shaping green behaviour. Many participants shared that their choices to buy green products—such as organic cotton kurtas, chemical-free soaps, and handmade crafts—were influenced by friends, family, or community figures who champion sustainable living. This suggests that green product adoption often follows a social diffusion model rather than an entirely individualistic decision-making process. People are more likely to trust and try new green brands when they come recommended by someone in their circle, particularly when combined with real-life testimonials rather than advertisements. This pattern was notably stronger among women respondents, particularly homemakers and working professionals in semi urban areas. ",
          "Another emergent insight was the intersection of digital literacy and green consumption. Respondents who had access to smart phones and were comfortable using online platforms reported being more informed and eco-friendly brands and were more likely to experiment with them. Digital access enabled them to compare prices, read reviews, explore brand stories, and engage with green influencers on platforms like Instagram and YouTube. On the contrary, those who lacked digital confidence or infrastructure were largely unaware of the green alternatives or sceptical of their claims. This points to a digital divide that indirectly limits sustainable consumption, emphasising the need for digital literacy to be integrated into the environmental policy framework. ",
          "The data also revealed an interesting aspiration quality of a green consumption. Among middle-income respondents, there was a recurring theme that buying green products signified upper mobility, awareness and sophistication. For some, green consumption was less about ecology and more about social signalling—a way to align with global urban trends or distinguish oneself from the masses. While this may appear superficial, it nonetheless opens a window of opportunity for policy makers and brands. If sustainability is seen as fashionable or aspiration, it can be leveraged to build a wider consumer base. ",
          "Several respondents voice a desire for more government-led initiatives to promote green product education. Many indicated they would be more likely to ship their consumption habits if they saw greater public sector endorsement—such as television, camping school based programs or green product fairs supported by municipal bodies. This reflects a deep-seated trust in the state role as an arbiter for credible information. Interestingly, some even suggested that celebrities or government ambassadors advocating for specific green brands would influence their decisions more than NGO campaigns and social media influencers. This aligns with India’s socio-political context where government visibility still carries significant weight in legitimising behaviour. ",
          "A surprising insight that emerged from the case study of FabIndia was the importance of sensory and tactical engagement in promoting green products. Several participants who had visited physical FabIndia stores emphasised that the feel of organic cotton, the earthy scent of natural soaps, and the visual aesthetic of handicraft decor pieces played a strong role in converting their interest into purchase. This implies that experiential factors can be powerful triggers in promoting sustainable behaviour, especially when green alternatives are perceived as more sensorially rewarding than their synthetic counterparts. ",
          "Finally, intersectionality played a critical, though often overlooked, role in shaping adoption patterns. Women, for example, were not only more inclined towards green consumption but they were also more likely to be the primary decision-makers for household purchases. However, they were simultaneously more constrained by financial limitations and social expectations. Even enthusiastic and informed women often reported that their purchasing power was overridden by elders in family decisions. This highlights the importance of tailoring green policy and communication strategies to specific demographic realities rather than relying on generic solutions. ",
          "In summary, these additional insights highlight the multifaceted green product adoption in India. From social trust networks to digital access, aspirational values, and sensory triggers, a wide range of behavioural and contextual factors influence how consumers interact with sustainable products. These findings underscore the need for an integrated approach that goes beyond economic incentives and awareness campaigns to include emotional, social, and cultural dimensions of consumption. Recognising and acting on these settlers can help bridge the gap between green intentions and actions, and more fully realise the environmental goals embedded in Make in India initiative."

    conclusion: [
      "This study set out to explore whether the Make in India initiative promotes the adoption of green products among Indian consumers, using FabIndia as a key case study. The research finds that while there is growing environmental consciousness and rising interest in green consumption, a significant gap remains between awareness, intention, and actual purchasing behaviour. These gaps are shaped by a confluence of factors—affordability, access, cultural perceptions, and trust.",
      "The Make in India policy, although conceived primarily as a manufacturing and industrial strategy, has inadvertently laid a foundation that could be leveraged to encourage green consumerism by promoting indigenous production, reviving traditional practices and fostering local employment. The initiative naturally aligns with the ethos of sustainability. However, this potential remains underutilised at the consumer level. Make in India lacks visibility as a green movement; most people do not associate their purchase of locally made eco-friendly products with broader national goals. This disconnection reflects both a policy and communication gap. ",
      "The case study of FabIndia reinforces the value of trust, cultural rootedness and authenticity in driving green consumption. Consumers associate FabIndia with transparency, ethical sourcing, and heritage. These associations, combined with brand alignment into Indian values and aesthetics enhance its screen credibility. However, even a widely respected brand like FabIndia faces challenges in price, accessibility and availability outside urban centres, suggesting that structural barriers continue to inhibit the scale of green adoption ",
      "To bridge the gap between policy, intent, and consumer behaviour, this paper proposes several key policy directions. First, Make in India must be reframed and rebranded as a green mission, not just an economic one. public messaging and product labelling should be consistently connected with sustainable consumption with national goals. Second, the government should introduce targeted subsidies and initiatives for eco-conscious producers so that green products become more accessible across the income groups. Third, transparent eco-certification systems are essential to combat greenwashing and build consumer trust in sustainable goods. Fourth, distribution systems must be expanded so that green goods are not confined to elite urban spaces, public-private partnerships involving green brands, cooperatives, and self-help groups. Fifth, democratic access, digital literacy, and sustainability education must be prioritised to enable more informed consumption. Finally, campaigns must be localised and culturally contextualised, rooting green behaviour in traditional Indian knowledge systems and regional languages.",
      "In conclusion,  this research finds that green adoption in India is both an individual choice and a systematic challenge. Consumers are willing and increasingly aware but require an enabling environment, reliable information, and culturally resonant cues to consistently choose sustainability. If the Make in India initiative is recalibrated to incorporate ecological responsibilities alongside economic goals, transformative potential. A “Green Make in India” could serve as a uniquely Indian model of sustainable development, deeply rooted in tradition yet forward-looking in its ambition. ",
      "Further research could extend these insights to sectors such as agriculture, housing and mobility, offering a broad framework for inclusive and green policymaking. As India navigates the dual challenge of development and environmental reservation, aligning citizens' behaviour with national policy through trust,  access, and shared values will be critical. The time is right for a collaborative effort between state, market, and civil society to usher in a greener, more inclusive future."

      "Environment has been derived from a French word “Environia” means to surround. The word environment means surroundings in which organisms live. As a traditional Indian saying goes ‘Don’t destroy the very thing that sustains you’, this wisdom reminds us not to harm the environment that sustains all life and provides our needs. The Air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil in which we play are the most important elements of this world and are an integral part of everyone’s life.   The environment forms the foundation of human survival and development, influencing health, livelihood, and the sustainability of ecosystems. Environmental pollution significantly threatens human existence, with WHO reports showing that household air pollution alone killed 3.2 million people worldwide in 2020, and water pollution killed 1.4 million people according to their September 2023 report. However, rapid urbanization, unsustainable industrial practices, and weak regulatory enforcement have led to an escalating environmental crisis that directly impacts public health and economic stability as part of the current era, we have seen many researches and reports which indicate the severity of the situation and yet we are just sitting and repeating the same mistakes again and again. It's time to build up our awareness and accept the ringing bell for environment quality restoration."

          "The tendency of human beings has escorted to the path of development and that has not been restricted to the bare needs of survival, but it has crossed the limits and has gone beyond the extravagance. This drift has created havoc and great menace to the green and clean environment. Urbanization and technological development have put the survival of the planet in danger by degrading the quality of the environment’s essential elements like air, water and soil due to the release of hazardous waste from factories like plastics, heavy metals, nitrates, burning of fossil fuels, acid rain, oil spills and industrial toxins. Modern environmental protection has its roots in 19th century private legal actions for protection of private rights, like enjoyment of property and nuisance law (Hughes 1986). According to the United Nations, human activities have been the primary driver of climate change since the 1800s through burning fossil fuels, with climate scientists showing humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Environmental law emerged as a distinct field in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the concept of protecting ecosystems, water, and air masses as unified geographical units under law gained recognition. Talking about India, we have seen many citizens violating the laws set in by the government regarding protection of the environment. In this article we have shown how the country and globe has been facing many issues regarding environment depletion be it from air pollution, water pollution or e-waste pollution etc. "

          "As we are aware of the situation in the world wherein there has been an increase in global warming and environmental depletion, this has primarily been caused by the citizens of various countries as a whole. Talking about India, we have seen many citizens violating the laws set in by the government regarding protection of the environment. I believe that the human tendency to throw our wastes anywhere has caused a lot of issues which we are facing as a citizen of the country. During the train journey in India, we are able to see how much waste materials be it plastic bottles, papers, toffee wrappers etc have been thrown on the tracks. During any free land, we see waste materials dumped as it is and this is not all we have seen many unprotected dumped areas which are causing health depletions in the areas. We have seen a lot of cases of health depletion due to such radioactive environments and thus we require implementation of strict laws and awareness seminars so as to make the people aware about the current situation and where the future is headed. In this article we have shown how the country and globe has been facing many issues regarding environment depletion be it from air pollution, water pollution or e-waste pollution etc. Air pollution is more than just an environmental problem since it reveals systemic flaws in civic responsibility, regulation, and governance. Ecological systems and public health are at risk when policy frameworks are not implemented effectively. It affects biodiversity, urban infrastructure, and future generations' rights. ",
          "To defend clean air as essential to the right to life, judicial bodies have intervened and interpreted Article 21 of the Constitution. This evolving jurisprudence has transformed clean air from an environmental concern into a legal entitlement. IIT Delhi research links industry and automobiles to major urban PM2.5 emissions, while CSE observes growing contributions from waste burning and construction. The UNEP 2022 report warns of a potential drop in life expectancy of up to 5.3 years in polluted regions, supported by findings from the State of Global Air 2023, which reveal hazardous air quality across India. Air pollution in India emerges through distinct patterns, with urban, agricultural, and industrial sources converging to create a persistent public health emergency. Delhi, one of the most affected cities, frequently records hazardous PM2.5 levels, particularly in winter. In November 2019, a public health emergency was declared as pollution spiked, and Diwali festivities that year, marked by widespread firecracker use, significantly worsened the air quality. Seasonal crop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana is another key contributor to North India’s pollution load. According to the Ministry of Environment, Punjab alone reported over 29,000 stubble burning incidents in 2022, intensifying regional air toxicity. Industrial pollutants, especially in urban belts, further compound the issue. The Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India ordered the relocation of heavily polluting industries from the Delhi NCR region and introduced the principle of absolute liability, establishing a pivotal legal precedent for environmental accountability. Furthermore, A socially inclusive, legally based strategy is necessary to address India's air pollution problem. Priority should be given to bolstering adherence to Article 21 through enforceable emission limits, real-time data transparency, and judicial review. The National Clean Air Program’s (NCAP) accountability and reach would be improved by statutory support. More authority and the ability to take decisive action must be given to pollution control boards.",
          "Civic ownership can be fostered through public awareness campaigns and behavioral nudges, particularly with regard to the use of firecrackers, burning of waste, and vehicle choices. Municipalities are required to incorporate air quality objectives into urban planning at the local level. Deterrence would be strengthened legally if the M.C. Mehta principle of absolute liability were incorporated into all environmental laws. Socially, citizen monitoring platforms and clean technology incentives can promote long-term participation. Ultimately, clean air must not remain an aspirational goal, it must be realized as a lived constitutional right for every citizen."

          "Introduction:",
          "India’s journey toward becoming a Viksit Bharat by 2047 is driven by a digital revolution, but this rapid technological advancement brings with it the growing challenge of electronic waste. E-waste refers to discarded electronic and electrical devices that have reached the end of their useful life or are no longer functional. It includes devices such as computers, printers, phones, chargers, batteries, TVs, ACs, refrigerators, and other household electronics. India is the world’s third-largest e-waste producer after China and the US, generating 3.8 million metric tons worth $6 billion in 2024 alone. As one of the fastest-growing electronics markets, managing e-waste is becoming a major sustainability challenge",
          "Government Measures to address E-Waste:",
          "The Ministry of Environment & Forests & Climate Change (MoEFCC) oversees environmental legislation in India, while the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an autonomous body under the MoEFCC, drafts guidelines and advises on environmental policy matters. Government of India first announced the e-waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2011. E-waste Management Rules 2016: These rules apply to all manufacturers, producers, consumers, dismantlers, and recyclers involved in the lifecycle of e-waste and electronic equipment. Extended Producer Responsibility [EPR] introduced under these rules mandates producers must declare recycling targets, set at 30% of the e-waste expected from past sales. The Deposit Refund Scheme allows producers to charge a deposit at sale, refunded with interest when the end-of-life equipment is returned by the consumer. E waste Management Rules 2022: It addressed collaboration between formal recyclers and the informal sector to maintain a steady material supply. The informal sector aids collection, while recyclers handle segregation and recovery. Hence, synergy between the two is essential.E waste Management Amendment Rules 2024: The CPCB will set the price range for EPR certificate exchange, capped at 100% and floored at 30% of the environmental compensation for unfulfilled obligations.",
          "Impact on Health:",
          "Electronic goods contain toxic substances like mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants which are hazardous and improper disposal of these toxins into soil, water, and air, causes health issues like neurological disorders, respiratory problems, kidney damage, and even cancer. if suitable measures are not taken, the toxic substances can enter the body through respiratory tracks, skin, through mucous membrane of the mouth and digestive tracks.",
          "Role and Risks of Informal/Unorganized Sector in E-Waste Recycling:",
          "India's unorganized sector comprises small informal businesses operating without health or environmental safeguards. Workers often handle toxic materials without protective gear, exposing themselves to harmful gases, acid solutions, and contaminated residues. Over 90% of the country’s e-waste ends up in this sector, primarily located in urban slums of metros and mini-metros, where unskilled labourers use rudimentary methods to minimize costs. Recycling is often done in homes, putting families and the environment at risk. For example, gas torches are used to extract metals from circuit boards by melting solder, or through open burning and acid stripping. These methods release dangerous toxins. Child labour is sometimes employed to dismantle components using simple tools, with reusable parts sold and the rest burned to extract metal. Due to weak collection systems, households and institutions store outdated electronics, or sell them for refurbishment and resale. As a result, only a fraction of obsolete electronics reaches formal recycling facilities. For instance, TIC Group India Pvt. Ltd 10,000 sq. ft. dismantling unit in Noida, with a capacity of 500 tonnes per year, remains underutilized due to limited input.",
          "Role of the Formal/Organized Sector in E-Waste Recycling:",
          "The formal sector plays a crucial role in effective and environmentally sound e-waste management. Registered dismantlers and recyclers utilize the highest levels of technology and standardized practices to recover valuable materials with the least amount of environmental impact. They comply with regulatory requirements, protect workers, and assist in monitoring and reporting flows of e-waste through accurate documentation. The formal sector also promotes the enforcement of EPR schemes in collaboration with producers to achieve recycling targets.",
          "Trends:",
          "The CPCB estimates the e-waste generation at national level based on the countrywide sales data provided by producers and average life of notified electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), as mandated under the E-waste Management Rules, 2016. According to data presented by Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, India witnessed a surge in electronic waste generation over the past five years, rising from 1.01 million metric tonnes (MT) in 2019-20 to 1.751 million MT in 2023-24, =",

In response, the NGT sought status reports from the State Pollution Control Boards of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh. In its decision, the NGT directed producers to establish e-waste collection centers, comply with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) obligations, and raise public awareness through proper labelling and advertisements. State Pollution Control Boards were instructed to enforce authorizations, monitor the activities of producers, dismantlers, and recyclers, and issue notices for registration.

This poignant line resonates deeply with the escalating crisis of water pollution, particularly concerning our vital groundwater resources. Despite water being fundamental to life, its importance is often overlooked, leading to severe human-induced contamination and depletion. India, a nation striving for industrial growth, faces a particularly acute challenge. While 75.2% of the Earth's potable water is frozen in polar regions, a significant 22.6% exists as groundwater. However, increasing reliance on this finite resource by industry, agriculture, and municipalities, coupled with inadequate legal frameworks, has led to widespread pollution. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 was India’s first comprehensive legislation aimed at regulating water pollution. However, ambiguities in definitions, lenient penalties, and enforcement lapses have limited its efficacy. It lacks provisions for radiological contamination, groundwater-specific regulation, and meaningful public participation. Judicial activism has stepped in through the Landmark cases such as Subhash Kumar v. The State of Bihar and Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum expanded Article 21: Right to Life to include the right to pollution-free water. The way forward demands a unified, enforceable legal regime as the groundwater is not infinite and it must be preserved not just as a resource, but as a public trust so as to help the future generations survive and not face clean water shortages.",

Sewage Wastewater and Industrial Waste: One of the main reasons for water elements being eliminated is the inadequate scientific processing of the sewage wastes which eventually after treatment gets included into normal river water. As per the United Nations 80% of the water wastage is not being treated and having been included into the environment without scientific processing.",
          "2.Oil Spills: The second main reason for water having polluted elements is the release of ship oils or wastes directly into the river. I believe the oceans have been one of the most exploited water bodies due to such following events of spilling of oil or ship waste into the river. ",
          " 3.	Nuclear Waste: During the nuclear attacks or nuclear making, radioactive wastes are not being trusted properly. In April 2021, Japan discharged contaminated water containing radioactive materials from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea. Though the Japanese government claims potential health risks and damage to marine life to be minimal as the wastewater has been treated, close monitoring is required to ensure there are no environmental effects from the water pollution.

          "The foundation for environmental protection as a constitutional right was laid in Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar (1991), where the Supreme Court held that the right to pollution-free air and water is intrinsic to Article 21. This landmark interpretation transformed environmental harm from a regulatory concern into a fundamental rights violation, anchoring clean air within the broader framework of human dignity. This legal recognition is echoed and reinforced by growing scientific evidence. The Air Quality Life Index (2023) reveals that air pollution can reduce life expectancy in Indian hotspots by up to seven years, while studies by CREA and TERI highlight the chronic health burden on children and urban populations due to persistent exposure to PM2.5 and toxic emissions. Beyond legal and health frameworks, the crisis exposes deep inequities in environmental access. Communities in low-income or industrially dense areas suffer disproportionate exposure, often without the means for protection making air pollution not just a public health emergency, but a question of environmental justice and inclusive governance.

[AIR 1985 SC 652], has emphasized on the very fact that to live in free and clean environment is the fundamental right of every citizen of India as it forms integral part of Article 21 of Constitution of India. But it is a bitter reality that the electronic waste which is outdated contains various toxic metals and chemicals; that directly or indirectly affects the human health and consequently, suffers due to the fatal consequences of the same. These can hamper the right to lead a healthy life. E – Waste is a man-made disaster which has posed an immense jeopardize situation to the present generation to cope with its after effects.",
          "Case Study: Ganga Action Plan (GAP):",
          "Launched in 1986, the Ganga Action Plan was India’s first major attempt to clean the sacred river. Despite huge investments, the plan failed to deliver lasting results. A 2020 report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that 60% of the Ganga still remains polluted, mainly due to untreated sewage and industrial discharge. The GAP serves as a stark reminder that without local participation and strict enforcement, even the best-intentioned policies falter. Itis estimated that 11 million metric tons of plastic enter the oceans every year (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2020). This plastic not only chokes marine life but also breaks down into microplastics, which have now been found in human blood and placenta. Water pollution is no longer “out there”—it is inside us. This reveals how pollution is not just environmental, but deeply personal and biological. ",

Union of India (1996) The Supreme Court addressed pollution by tanneries in Tamil Nadu, recognizing the right to clean water and environment under Article 21. It firmly adopted the “Precautionary Principle” and “Polluter Pays Principle”, stating that development should not be at the cost of environmental destruction. This case helped establish sustainable development as a guiding doctrine in Indian environmental jurisprudence. ",

Shri Vardhichand & Ors.; Supreme Court of India: In this landmark case the residents of Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh filed a complaint against the Municipal Council for failing to construct proper drains and control unhygienic conditions caused by nearby slums and industrial area. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate directed the municipality to prepare a development plan within six months, a decision upheld by the High Court. The municipality appealed to the Supreme Court, citing lack of funds. The respondents argued that the municipality failed in its duty to safeguard public health. The Supreme Court ruled that a clean environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. It directed the municipality to implement sanitation measures, including separate public latrines, water supply, and scavenging services within six months. The Court stated that lack of funds was no excuse and advised the municipality to seek financial support from the State Government or public health savings. This judgment emphasized that public health and environmental protection are non-negotiable duties of municipal authorities. ",

    conclusion: [
      "India’s environmental crisis is no longer a distant threat it is a lived reality affecting public health, constitutional rights, and intergenerational equity. As the nation struggles with toxic air, increasing e-waste, and worsening water quality, it becomes evident that legal measures alone are insufficient. The escalating environmental challenges of air pollution, e-waste, and water contamination demand urgent, collective action to safeguard human health, biodiversity, and planetary sustainability. Based on statistics from international and national institutions, the data reveals increasing rates of air pollution and its threatening impact on people’s health and mortality. People know about environmental issues, but civic responsibility must be ensured through government bodies that enforce environmental regulations framed to protect the environment. Most of the cities of India are being suffered by extremely high level of urban air pollution particularly in the form of CO, SO2, NO2, PM (Particulate Matter) and RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter). These issues, driven by unsustainable practices and lax enforcement, threaten not only ecosystems but also the fundamental rights enshrined in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, as affirmed by judicial precedents. For e-waste, fostering a circular economy through incentivized recycling and stricter producer accountability is essential. Water security hinges on modernizing treatment systems, curbing industrial runoff, and protecting groundwater as a shared legacy. By uniting technological innovation, legal enforcement, and public engagement, we can forge a resilient, equitable future. Therefore, it is high time that we seek holistic solutions beyond mere awareness, focusing on individual and collective responsibility through environmental civic sense, which requires both personal action and policy changes. We need stronger legal frameworks, as seen in cases such as M.C. Mehta, but enforcement remains weak, necessitating stricter and more enforceable policies."

    abstract: [
      "This paper looks closely at the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), one of India’s flagship maternal health schemes, through the layered realities of caste, gender, and class. While the scheme has led to a rise in institutional deliveries and helped in reducing maternal and neonatal death rates, these gains have not reached everyone equally. Dalit, Adivasi, and other marginalized women continue to face barriers that go beyond just policy. They face exclusion rooted in deep social hierarchies, everyday discrimination, and a healthcare system that often fails to see them with dignity. Using insights from literature, data trends, and policy reviews, this study brings out the structural gaps that limit JSY’s reach and impact. It draws attention to issues like fund delays, poor quality of care, and the absence of culturally sensitive support systems. The paper ends by suggesting concrete ways forward: from intersectional policy thinking to more inclusive implementation, from ground-up community involvement to systemic change, so that no woman is left behind in her most vulnerable moments."

    intro: [
      "In a nation striving for universal health coverage, a stark reality persists: millions of marginalized women in India continue to face profound barriers to essential healthcare. Despite policy initiatives and a growing economy, the intersection of gender, caste, and class creates a complex web of exclusion, denying equitable access to vital services.",
      "This paper aims to critically examine how the intricate interplay of gender, caste, and class profoundly influences healthcare and reproductive service access within India's marginalized communities. It seeks to illuminate the systemic disparities that persist despite national efforts, providing a comprehensive analysis of the challenges faced by vulnerable women. Furthermore, this study evaluates existing healthcare and reproductive health policies and programs through a gendered lens, assessing their effectiveness and identifying critical implementation gaps. By doing so, it underscores the urgent need for more equitable and responsive healthcare systems.",
      "The significance of this topic cannot be overstated, as it addresses a critical human rights issue and a major public health challenge in India. By dissecting the complex interplay of social determinants on healthcare access, this research contributes significantly to the field of public policy and health equity. The findings offer crucial insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and civil society organizations, enabling them to design and implement more targeted, culturally sensitive, and effective interventions. Ultimately, this paper aims to foster a deeper understanding of the barriers faced by marginalized women, advocating for systemic changes that ensure dignified, equitable, and comprehensive healthcare for all."

          "The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the need of all women having access to mental and physical health care. However, women who are marginalized in particular are more deprived of these benefits. Numerous studies have also been done on the unmet healthcare requirements of women and ways to improve their access to healthcare. The provision of healthcare services that take into account the sociodemographic, cultural, and other variables related to marginalized women has, however, received little attention in the literature so far (Puja et al., 2024). Gender disparities in health are exacerbated by the replication of restrictive gender norms in health systems.",
          " Khanday and Akram (2012) discusses how the system in India has failed at the implementation level to provide healthcare access to marginalized groups for a long time. The study focuses on the health status of marginalized groups and the exploitation women’s face and the violations of their rights. The study analyzes the determinants on the basis of which Individuals who belong to marginalized groups face discrimination in healthcare, like how women face double discrimination, as in case of gender and marginalization due to other variables.",
          "Ali and Chauhan (2020) demonstrate the enduring socioeconomic disparities in the consumption of maternal health services in rural India. Full prenatal care showed less improvement, despite a notable improvement in the disparity in competent birth attendance. They point to tribal status, mass media exposure, and secondary/higher education as major causes of the remaining discrepancies.",
          " In their discussion of the gender-class relationship, Mahapatro, James, and Mishra (2021) illustrate the class gradient in unmet needs. According to an intersectional approach, Scheduled Caste/Tribe members of the lower class have significantly more unmet needs than those who are not SC/ST. 12 % of the total population is having unmet healthcare needs, where poorer women are more affected when caste and gender intersect.",
          "Mishra et al. (2021) discuss the caste-based inequities in accessing India’s Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), which is a safe motherhood intervention aimed at reducing maternal and neonatal mortality by promoting institutional deliveries. While 72% of the JSY access gap is explained by observable factors like primarily wealth quintile, type of delivery, and education, a significant 28% unexplained disparity shows the persistent caste discrimination.",
          "The authors underscore that persistent caste bias continues to impede fair access to maternal health benefits, especially among SC/ST women. Mishra (2006) analyzes how the inequalities in Indian society and the limitations (financial and social) of certain groups have impacted the gender disparity in the access to healthcare. According to the National Family Health Survey-2, around 35.8 % of women in India suffer from chronic energy deficiency, with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 kg/m². Before NFHS-2 the average maternal mortality rate at the national level was 540 deaths per 100,000 live births for a two year period.",
          "A lack of sufficient data shows the gap of an intersectional approach in healthcare services and research is evident here. After analyzing the existing discourses, this paper tries to examine how the intersection of gender, caste, and class influences access to healthcare and reproductive services in India in case of marginalized communities. With an objective to analyze the existing healthcare and reproductive health policies and programs through a gendered lens this paper tries to evaluate the gender budgeting and resource allocation for women's health. At last this paper tries to propose evidence based recommendations for more inclusive and effective policy interventions by critically appraising the outcomes of these policies and implementation gaps as well."

        paragraphs: [
          "Health care must be used to enhance the dignity and respect for human rights by providing everyone access to basic services. However, in India, this vision remains a dream for many marginalized communities—specifically, Dalit women, who encounter profound systemic challenges influenced by both gender and caste dynamics.",
          "Dalit women, who make up about 16.6% of the total female population of India (Census of India, 2011), are doubly marginalized. Their lives are not only shaped by patriarchal systems but also by the caste system, which has historically placed them on the fringes of social systems. Even as legal systems and state programs claim to guarantee equality, caste and gender discrimination continues to deprive them of even basic healthcare facilities.",
          "Studies demonstrate that discriminatory practice starts at the most basic levels. Acharya (2010) and Sabharwal et al. (2014) demonstrate that frontline health workers avoid entering Dalit localities, avoid or postpone or deny services, and maintain physical distance when interacting with Dalit women. For example, medicines are dropped from a height instead of being handed over directly, anganwadi workers maintain physical distance from babies, and mothers are asked to weigh their own infants. Such seemingly minor acts send a powerful message: that the lives of Dalits are not equal in importance.",
          "Sabharwal et al. (2014) in a seven-state survey in India had also reported that Dalit women were much less likely to avail themselves of proper antenatal and postnatal care. They were not even aware of government programs like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), and even if they were, they did not receive the benefits assured in general. Thorat and Lee (2010) also noted that Dalit women were 33% less likely than upper-caste women to avail themselves of JSY because of institutional neglect and discrimination on the basis of caste.",
          "National data reinforces such inequality. NFHS-5 (2019–21) shows that 68.1% of Scheduled Caste women had antenatal care provided to them by a skilled personnel only, while 82.3% women from the general category had the same (International Institute for Population Sciences [IIPS] & ICF, 2021). Institutional delivery and immunization of children are also notably lower for Dalit and tribal women.",
          "Discrimination is not only in the health domain, but also in state nutrition programs such as the Midday Meal Scheme, where Dalit children are discriminated against by being seated apart, served last, or excluded from receiving extra helpings (Thorat & Lee, 2010). These activities perpetuate humiliation and social exclusion from an early age.",
          "Paul Farmer (2004) calls this structural violence—not harm which occurs as a result of personal design, but of entrenched inequality. For Dalit women, health care becomes yet another site where exclusion, indignity, and neglect become the norm.",
          "To get closer to actual equity, we need to grapple with how caste and gender still influence access to healthcare in India—not only in policy, but also in practice on a day-to-day basis."

JSY is a key public health policy under the National Health Mission. It was launched to encourage childbirth in healthcare institutions as a means to lower risks for mothers and newborns. This section analyses national level data from 2014-15 to 2022-23 to understand its reach and impact. By studying the number of women who have availed benefits from JSY and observing trends in maternal mortality rate and neonatal mortality, we aim to evaluate how well the scheme has worked over the years.",
          "Janani Suraksha Yojana is a policy that targets improving maternal health and neonatal health under the National Health Mission. It was launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in April 2005. By promoting childbirth in medical facilities, the scheme seeks to lower risks for mothers and newborns, particularly among the women from marginalised sections of the society. Through conditional cash support, the scheme motivates women to seek antenatal services, give birth in healthcare institutions and access proper postnatal care. These cash benefits help reduce the cost burden. Accredited Social Health Activities (ASHAs) play a crucial role in identifying eligible women, encouraging them to go for regular check-ups and ensure they receive timely care both before and after childbirth.",
          "Methodology:",
          "For this study we have relied on secondary data collected from government sources, such as reports published by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The key indicators we focused on include the number of women who received JSY benefits, changes in maternal mortality and neonatal mortality over the years. We've looked at data ranging from 2014-15 to 2022-23. By comparing the data year by year, we aim to understand the progress of the scheme and how efficiently it has met its goals over the years. Therefore, instead of relying on advanced statistical models, this study adopts a descriptive approach to observe year-wise trends.",
          "The following analysis presents the descriptive statistics of JSY beneficiaries, maternalmortality, and neonatal mortality rates in India from 2014–15 to 2022–23. Over this period,the number of JSY beneficiaries ranged from 96.95 lakh to 110.21 lakh, with a median of104.16 lakh. The low variance (16.48) and slight positive skew (0.22) suggest thatbeneficiary uptake has remained relatively stable, with gradual increases over time.",
          "In contrast, the maternal mortality rate varied more widely, ranging from 90 to 155 deaths per100,000 live births, with a high variance (420.11) and a positively skewed distribution (0.64),indicating uneven declines. The neonatal mortality rate was more consistent, ranging between18.15 and 27.09, with a lower variance (9.68) and a nearly symmetrical (slightly negative)skew (–0.006), suggesting relatively uniform outcomes over time.",
          "Overall, while JSY has helped improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, the data suggestsuneven impact on maternal health and a need for deeper outreach, especially in underservedregions and among marginalized populations",
          "The trend analysis reveals a gradual increase in the number of JSY beneficiaries from2014–15 to 2019–20, followed by a slight dip during 2020–21, likely due to COVID-19disruptions, before stabilizing again. The maternal mortality rate shows an overall decliningtrend, but with significant fluctuation—most notably a sharp spike in 2021–22, which mayreflect panemic-related service gaps, before dropping again in 2022–23.",
          "Meanwhile, neonatal mortality rates have declined consistently and steadily, indicating morestable progress in newborn health outcomes.",
          "While the data suggests that JSY has had a positive correlation with improved maternal andneonatal health over time, the irregularities in maternal mortality trends raise questions aboutprogram resilience, especially during crises. These trends underscore the need for strongersafety nets, improved last-mile service delivery, and continued policy attention to reachmarginalize women, particularly during health emergencies."

          "While the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) has notably increased institutional births andcontributed to declining maternal and infant mortality rates (MMR from 254 to 97, IMR from57 to 32) (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, various years), its full potential is hinderedby systemic inefficiencies",
          "A critical appraisal reveals JSY's limited effectiveness in ensuring comprehensive antenatal(ANC) and postnatal care (PNC), which are crucial for holistic maternal health (Lim et al.,2010). Delays in fund disbursement, sometimes exceeding a year, undermine the scheme'sfinancial incentives, particularly for vulnerable families (The Indian Express, 2024). Thisfinancial burden, coupled with healthcare system flaws, pushes families to the brink(Livemint, 2024)",
          "Quality of care remains a significant challenge. Despite increased institutional deliveries,access to consistent ANC and PNC is inconsistent. Unused equipment due to lack of trainedtechnicians, as seen at Cottage Hospital in Dahanu, forces women into expensive private care(Livemint, 2024). India's shortage of skilled healthcare workers, below WHOrecommendations, directly impacts maternal care quality and institutional birth rates (WorldHealth Organization, ongoing reports). Reliable emergency transport and referral systems, asin Assam and Haryana, prove critical for safe childbirth (Livemint, 2024).",
          "Furthermore, JSY's inclusiveness is questioned in regions where poverty and lack ofeducation persist. States like Bihar and Jharkhand show low institutional birth rates despiteincentives (IIPS & ICF, 2021). Education is a strong determinant; more educated women arealmost four times more likely to deliver in a facility (Singh & Singh, 2012). Culturallysensitive communication is also vital; initial resistance among tribal communities in Jhabuadistrict highlights the need for tailored approaches (Sharma & Sharma, 2017)."

          "Beyond the structural and programmatic challenges already discussed, recent insightshighlight several critical dimensions impacting healthcare access for marginalized women inIndia. Despite notable progress in maternal and child health indicators, significant disparitiespersist, particularly for women residing in rural areas, those from lower socioeconomic strata,and tribal communities. These inequalities are often exacerbated by geographical barriers,out-of-pocket expenses, and the absence of female healthcare providers, reinforcing the needfor more localized and accessible service delivery models.",
          "A broader understanding of women's health is also gaining traction, moving beyond purelyreproductive health to encompass a wider spectrum of issues. This includes addressingprevalent challenges such as malnutrition, anemia, and the rising burden ofnon-communicable diseases like breast cancer and cardiovascular conditions, whichdisproportionately affect women. Mental health disorders, often compounded by poverty andsocial stigma, also represent a critical area requiring more focused attention and integratedcare.",
          "Technology emerges as a powerful enabler, with telemedicine platforms offeringtransformative solutions to bridge distance and accessibility gaps. These digital healthinitiatives can facilitate remote consultations and reduce the need for arduous travel, provingparticularly beneficial for women in underserved regions. However, the existing digitalgender gap, where women often have lower access to mobile phones and the internet,necessitates targeted interventions to ensure equitable digital literacy and access for thispotential to be fully realized.",
          "Furthermore, the importance of community-based interventions and women's empowermentis increasingly recognized. Engaging local leaders, fostering peer education, and buildingwomen's groups can effectively disseminate health information, promote positivehealth-seeking behaviors, and address underlying power imbalances that hinder access.Empowering women through education, financial independence, and enhanceddecision-making autonomy is crucial, as these factors directly correlate with improvedhealthcare utilization and better health outcomes. These additional perspectives underscorethe need for a holistic, multi-pronged approach that integrates technological advancements,community participation, and sustained efforts towards social empowerment to truly achieveequitable healthcare for all marginalized women in India."

    conclusion: [
      "Our analysis of the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) revealed its positive correlation withimproved maternal and neonatal outcomes, yet also highlighted inconsistencies andvulnerabilities, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, thecritical appraisal of existing policies exposed significant shortcomings, including delays infund disbursement, inadequate quality of care, human resource deficiencies, and persistentsocio-demographic barriers. The discussion emphasized that while policies exist, theireffective implementation is often hampered by deep-rooted inequalities and a lack ofculturally sensitive approaches, preventing the full realization of equitable healthcare for all.",
      "The findings of this study carry profound implications for public health policy and practice inIndia. They underscore that achieving universal healthcare coverage is not merely aboutincreasing service availability but fundamentally about dismantling the structural barriersrooted in social hierarchies and gender norms. The persistent disparities highlighted hereindemonstrate that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to health policy is insufficient; instead,interventions must be tailored to address the unique vulnerabilities arising from theintersection of caste, class, and gender. Recognizing the uneven impact of programs like JSY,particularly on the most marginalized, signifies the urgent need for robust monitoringmechanisms and adaptive strategies. Ultimately, ensuring equitable access to healthcare is notjust a matter of public health but a fundamental human right, essential for fostering socialjustice and sustainable development across the nation",
      "Moving forward, future research should delve deeper into the long-term impacts of digitalhealth initiatives on marginalized communities, specifically examining how the digital gendergap can be effectively bridged to maximize their benefits. Further qualitative studies areneeded to capture the lived experiences of women facing multiple forms of discriminationwithin healthcare settings, providing nuanced insights into the everyday realities of structuralviolence. From a policy perspective, there is a compelling need to integrate intersectionalanalysis into the design and evaluation of all health programs, ensuring that resourceallocation and implementation strategies explicitly address the specific needs of the mostvulnerable. Strengthening community-led health initiatives, investing significantly in thetraining and deployment of culturally competent healthcare professionals, and ensuringtimely and transparent financial aid disbursement are critical practical actions. Moreover, aconcerted effort to promote women's education and economic empowerment will serve as afoundational pillar for improving health outcomes, fostering greater autonomy, and ensuringdignified healthcare for every woman in India.",
      "In conclusion, while India has made commendable strides in public health, the journeytowards truly equitable healthcare for all its women remains ongoing. The insights gleanedfrom this analysis reiterate that health is inextricably linked to social justice. Addressing thedeeply entrenched issues of gender, caste, and class in healthcare requires not just policyreforms but a fundamental societal shift towards recognizing and valuing the inherent dignityand rights of every individual. By prioritizing inclusive policies, empowering marginalizedcommunities, and fostering a healthcare system that is truly responsive to diverse needs, Indiacan move closer to its vision of health for all, ensuring that no woman is left behind in thepursuit of well-being"

    abstract: [
      "After a gap of 34 years, the Government of India introduced the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 on July 29, 2020. This policy replaces the National Policy on Education (NPE) of 1986 and aims to transform India’s education system, aligning it with contemporary global standards and the needs of 21st-century learners. Notable reforms include a shift to the 5+3+3+4 academic structure, multiple exit and entry options at the undergraduate level, focused integration of vocational and multidisciplinary learning, and new assessment paradigms. The NEP aspires to make India a global knowledge superpower. However, realizing this vision requires overcoming persistent barriers of inequity, infrastructure, teacher quality, digital divide, and ensuring the inclusivity of marginalized groups. This paper critically examines NEP 2020, tracing its historical evolution, dissecting its salient features, evaluating its multifaceted impacts, and offering policy recommendations to promote effective and equitable implementation."

    intro: [
      "India’s education system, one of the world’s largest and most intricate, has evolved through millennia. Education in ancient India was anchored in the Gurukul system, characterized by immersive, holistic learning under revered gurus and oral transmission of knowledge. This spiritually and morally grounded pedagogy nurtured not only intellectual but also personal growth (Gupta, 2020). The arrival of British colonial rule ushered in transformative change: figures like Lord Macaulay pioneered English-language instruction and Western curricula, often marginalizing indigenous learning traditions and creating a dichotomy between traditional and modern educational paradigms (Kumar, 2005).",
      "Post-independence, the nation strove to democratize and expand access to education. The National Policy on Education (1968) introduced reforms that emphasized universal access, regional languages, and teacher training. The revised 1986 policy, updated in 1992, focused on achieving “Access and Equity,” especially for historically marginalized communities (Tilak, 2019). These efforts yielded considerable progress: school enrollment expanded, literacy rates rose, and opportunities broadened for many.",
      "Nevertheless, persistent challenges endured: chronic underfunding, inadequate infrastructure, poor teacher training, and wide disparities in learning outcomes, especially across rural-urban and socio-economic divides (Kingdon, 2007). As India’s economy and society globalized, education gaps became more evident. The 21st-century knowledge economy and digital revolution magnified the urgency for reform (Rao, 2019). Extensive consultations involving policymakers, educators, parents, and students culminated in NEP 2020, which envisions an education system that is flexible, inclusive, multidisciplinary, and deeply rooted in Indian values yet aligned with international best practices (MHRD, 2020). The journey from oral tradition in Gurukuls to policy-driven modernity reflects India’s ongoing quest to create equitable, world-class education for all."

          "India’s constitution states education as a joint responsibility of the central and state governments. The Right to Education (RTE) Act of 2009 enshrined free and compulsory education for all children aged 6 to 14 as a fundamental right. The Directive Principles of State Policy outlined in Article 45 further commit the State to providing early childhood care and education for children up to six years. NEP 2020’s vision of universal education from ages 3 to 18 thus necessitates reviewing and potentially amending constitutional provisions to broaden the guarantee of educational opportunity, enable harmonization with the RTE Act, and address overlaps with state and local governance structures. The policy also touches upon constitutional language provisions (Article 350A), expanding its scope by emphasizing mother-tongue instruction for all, not only for linguistic minorities."

          "Academic Structure Reform (5+3+3+4 Model): A revolutionary departure from the 10+2 system, NEP 2020 pioneers the 5+3+3+4 model: Foundational Stage (ages 3–8) integrates three years of pre-primary with Grades 1 and 2, emphasizing play-based learning; Preparatory Stage (8–11): Grades 3–5, focusing on discovery-based learning; Middle Stage (11–14): Grades 6–8, with experiential and vocational introduction; Secondary Stage (14–18): Grades 9–12, offering flexibility, choice, critical thinking, and holistic assessments and preparation for higher education or professional life. This structure aims to address the critical learning deficit in early childhood, offer seamless transitions, and allow for customized learner trajectories. ",
          "Flexible Undergraduate and Postgraduate Pathways: Undergraduate degrees can be completed in three or four years, with multiple exit and entry options (1-Year: Certificate, 2 Years: Diploma, 3 Years: Bachelor's, 4 Years: Advanced Bachelor's with research). The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) digitally tracks credits for academic mobility. Master's degrees are one year after a four-year UG course with research or two years after a three-year UG program; M.Phil. is discontinued.",
          "Holistic and Multidisciplinary Curriculum: Rigid barriers between science, arts, commerce, and vocational studies are broken down. Students can mix subjects and streams.

Flexibility and Individualization: Early exposure to diverse disciplines and multiple pathways allows for customized learning suited to a student’s aptitudes and interests. Inclusion: Universal access initiatives—especially integrating more than 32 million out-of-school children by 2030—prioritize bridging historic inequities. Cultural Identity: Emphasis on regional languages and Indian traditions instills pride, while strategic use of English and other languages prepares students for global engagement. Nevertheless, concerns remain that increased assessments and periodic board exams may inadvertently heighten anxiety and competitiveness. ",

For schools, this means reorganizing administrative structures, integrating digital tools, restructuring timetables, and developing inclusive learning environments. For higher education institutions, the onus is on enabling multidisciplinary learning, flexible curricula, innovation ecosystems, and research capacity. These reforms demand significant infrastructure, training, autonomy, and transparent governance. ",
          "Impact on Gender, Equity, and Marginalized Groups:",
          "The NEP aspires to universalize access and make learning inclusive at all levels: Marginalized Students: Outreach and scholarship programs, provisions for mother-tongue instruction, and technology-enabled access target rural, tribal, and differently-abled learners. Gender: Initiatives for gender-sensitive sanitation, transport, and safety aim to get more girls into and keep them in school, but dropout rates among rural girls remain high (~28% in recent data). Disability: The policy mandates physical accessibility, resource support, and differentiated pedagogies, although implementation gaps persist in most states. ",
          "Alignment With Socio-Economic and Cultural Realities - ",
          "NEP 2020 boldly balances India’s rich diversity with aspirations for global excellence. Provisions for local languages, indigenous arts, and knowledge traditions safeguard cultural heritage while broad access to digital and English-language resources fosters cosmopolitanism. Nevertheless, wide disparities in social, economic, and regional development present actual barriers to implementation and risk reproducing existing inequalities unless extra support is provided to those most disadvantaged."

      "This paper attempts to investigate the gap between reproductive health policies in India and their grassroots implementation. Special focus is given to marginalized women, mainly those from Dalit and tribal backgrounds. Although there are various legal frameworks such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act amendments, deep rooted impediments continue to restrict women's access to sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). Most mainstream literature focuses on service outreach metrics but fails to look into the intersectional realities of caste, class, age, and geography in health-system interactions.",
      "Methodologically, this paper builds on the qualitative approach with content analysis of policy documents, review of secondary data, and semi-structured interviews with women. Alongside, this paper explores the lacuna in SRHR. Primary focus is given to institutional bias, provider’s attitudes, and lack of infrastructure that result in denial or delay of services. Emphasizing lived experiences and examining the state's accountability in ensuring bodily autonomy, the research aims to offer a nuanced critique of India’s reproductive health landscape. The paper concludes with policy recommendations targeting both structural reforms and sensitization frameworks to make reproductive rights meaningfully accessible to marginalized women."

    intro: [
      "The foundation of bodily autonomy and gender equality is formed by sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). Central to human rights lies SRHR, which not only encompasses access to healthcare services but also the right to make informed choices about one's body (United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA], 2022).In India, the government’s unwavering commitments  towards women’s reproductive health can be witnessed through several legal and policy initiatives. The schemes include, Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act along with its 2021 amendments, and other maternal healthcare schemes (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare [MoHFW], 2021). In spite of these initiatives, there exists stark disparities in  the implementation of these rights, especially for women from marginalized backgrounds, including adolescents, Dalits, and tribal communities.",
      "Recent policy evaluations suggest that while India has improved certain reproductive health indicators such as reduced maternal mortality and increased institutional deliveries, qualitative aspects of care remain deeply compromised (Chatterjee, 2020). This discrepancy is particularly evident in the gap between high-level policy commitments and the lived experiences of women at the grassroots level. Studies increasingly reveal that social determinants such as caste, class, age, and geography play a crucial role in determining access to reproductive healthcare (Deshpande, 2022). Women from Dalit and tribal backgrounds often face layered marginalization in the form of institutional discrimination, infrastructural deficits, provider apathy, and limited awareness about their reproductive rights (Raj et al., 2023).",
      "Moreover, healthcare providers' attitudes and systemic biases frequently result in the denial or delay of services like safe abortion, contraception, and maternal care (Kumar & Rai, 2021). In many instances, services provided under schemes like JSY tend to reduce women to mere statistical targets, sidelining their autonomy and preferences. The focus on numerical achievements in public health metrics has diverted attention away from more complex, intersectional issues of dignity, agency, and consent in reproductive healthcare delivery (Chatterjee, 2020). Consequently, the promise of universal reproductive rights remains an illusion for large sections of marginalized women in India.",

          "This paper addresses these critical gaps by adopting a qualitative inquiry into how reproductive health policies are implemented in practice. Using content analysis of policy documents, a review of secondary literature, and semi-structured interviews with affected women and healthcare providers; it investigates how systemic biases, infrastructural shortcomings, and socio-cultural barriers collectively obstruct marginalized women from accessing dignified reproductive care. In doing so, the study confronts a central paradox: despite the presence of progressive reproductive health policies in India, marginalized women, particularly adolescents, Dalits, and tribal women continue to experience systemic exclusions that undermine their reproductive autonomy. By highlighting the disconnect between policy narratives and lived experiences, the paper aims to bridge this gap in scholarly discourse and policy evaluation, contributing towards a more grounded understanding of reproductive rights that goes beyond numerical outreach to address structural and attitudinal inequalities within India’s healthcare system."

        heading: "Thematic Literature Review ",
        paragraphs: [
          "It makes more sense from a theoretical standpoint to conduct a thorough investigation of SRHR-related impediments. Intersectionality theory, as pioneered by Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989), explains how multiple social identities (such as caste, gender, class, and religion) overlap to create complex yet unique experiences of discrimination and privilege. In the Indian context, this perspective is crucial for understanding why policies focused solely on gender or caste fail to address the compounded disadvantages faced by Dalit, tribal, and rural women. Laws and health programs frequently overlook these intertwined barriers while resulting in policies that do not effectively reach those who experience multiple forms of exclusion. An intersectional lens thus pushes for policy frameworks and interventions that are attuned to the specific circumstances of people at the margins and demands for a systematic recognition of how layered oppression functions within existing legal, institutional, and cultural settings. ",
          "Bodily contestation theory addresses the power struggles around who has the authority to make decisions regarding bodies while focusing on how autonomy, rights, and agency are regulated by social norms, legal systems, and institutional practices. In the context of reproductive and sexual health, this literature emphasizes on the ongoing battles between individual autonomy and societal/institutional constraints (such as legal requirements, medical gatekeeping, and moral policing). Contemporary analyses show that, despite improvements like the MTP Act and related legal reforms, genuine bodily autonomy for Indian women remains hindered by patriarchal structures, stigma, and the discretionary power of providers. Ultimately, this theory calls attention to the need for legal and policy reforms that secure real agency and dignity to ensure that individuals (especially women and marginalized groups) are empowered to make informed decisions about their own bodies free from coercion or undue interference.",
          "The literature study deconstructs the intricacy of SRHR by focusing on four main and connected issues.",
          "A.	Legal and Institutional policy and framework - There are still many gaps in its implementation that keep the people from fully benefiting from the initiatives, despite India's significant contributions to legal and policy frameworks, including the incorporation of the Right of Health under Article 21 and multiple rulings that made SRHR a crucial topic to concentrate on. Kapoor (2024) criticizes the MTP (Regulation) Act as being burdensome and doctor-centric, often requiring the consent of the spouse or family even if it is legal. The Government of India's Surrogacy Bill is criticized by Jakhar (2025) for upholding strict traditional norms by prohibiting unmarried and LGBTQ+ individuals from becoming parents. Women in India are still viewed as a means of population control, particularly in rural areas where sterilization camps are prevalent, according to the CREA Shadow Report (2018). It also mentions the ongoing issue of responsibility in society, which hinders community involvement and the opportunity to discuss their rights and the violence they encounter.",
          "B.	Multiple layers of Marginalization - Including the underprivileged in the benefits will help India reach SDG 5 because not everyone in India has access to reproductive rights, particularly the LGBTQ+ community, Adivasi or tribal people, religious minorities, adolescents, and those who are poor.In her research, Narang (2024) highlighted that pervasive identity differentiation (caste, creed, religion, etc.) will eventually make it more challenging for the general public to benefit from government initiatives. Tribal women may face discrimination and judgment even when they receive care, or they may have trouble traveling to hospitals. LGBTQ+ people, adolescents, and single people are also denied access to abortion services because of their nonconformity with the ideal family model. The CHJS (2015) states that research hardly ever discusses caste-related data or gender-sensitive topics, including their difficulties. It is therefore difficult for the government, service providers, and legislators to find answers and fill in the gaps.",
          "C.	Patriarchal control and Gender norms - There is still social stigma associated with discussing abortion, menstruation, and other sexual health issues in public. Women continue to be reluctant to discuss these difficulties in their families due to a number of societal constraints, which prevents them from participating in government-sponsored programs. Narang (2024) asserts that the patriarchal and social conventions around women date back to ancient times, when women were viewed as mothers, caregivers, and the moral pillars of the household. In some ways, these standards are still reflected in current policies, which prioritize motherhood and population control over bodily autonomy and choice. According to Khanna et al. (2022), women in urban areas frequently experience early marriages and rigid gender roles, which in some ways prevents them from evaluating SRHR. Despite the fact that abortion, menstruation, and other health services are safe and legal, women are reluctant to use them due to family pressure and fear of being judged. A Bollywood movie called Jayesh Bhai Jordaar also explores the same theme of social conventions and patriarchal control. In order to have a son, his wife has to undergo several abortions, and there are numerous other restrictions placed on women, such as the prohibition against using scented soaps to prevent male arousal.This demonstrates that patriarchal control is not just common in rural areas but also in impoverished urban areas.",
          "D.	Unawareness of SRHR - Lack of knowledge on SRHR remains a hurdle in spite of numerous legal attempts. Sharma (2025) asserts that in spite of numerous government-introduced policies, such as Beti Padhao and Beti Bachao, as well as numerous laws, a lack of public communication and other social norms causes a problem as it prevents women from accessing the services designed to help them. Grown et al. (2005) state that women can be made aware of SRHR through community involvement, education, counseling, and infrastructure improvements. When these elements are absent, women's sexual and reproductive health suffers. "

          "This study employs a systematic review design with qualitative, quantitative and intersectional research approach  to examine the gap between reproductive health policies and their ground-level implementation in India, specifically for marginalized women such as Dalits, Adivasis, and adolescents. The research focuses on how social hierarchies, institutional mechanisms, and policy frameworks interact to impact access to sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR).",
          "The study is based on both primary and secondary data. Primary data will be collected through  semi-structured interviews administered via digital platforms (Google Forms). These will be shared with women from represented and underrepresented communities. The use of both open-ended and close-ended questions is intended to obtain both personalized narratives and specific factual information regarding individuals’ access to and experiences with reproductive healthcare services. Although conducted remotely, this method allows for the collection of qualitative and quantitative data in a manner that is adaptable and sensitive to diverse contextual realities. The study will also conduct a document review of key policies and legal frameworks such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, and other related schemes. Using content analysis, these documents will be examined for the ways in which they construct eligibility, access, and entitlements – particularly in relation to caste, age, marital status, and geographic location.",
          "A review of secondary literature will be undertaken to understand the broader academic and policy discourse on SRHR in India. This will include research articles, survey data, and reports by government and non-governmental organizations. It will focus on identifying structural gaps, provider-level biases, and areas that remain under-researched. All collected data will be analyzed through thematic analysis that are aimed at identifying recurring patterns and issues related to systemic exclusion, delay, or denial of services. The analysis will be informed by feminist grounded  theories (like bodily contestation theory) as key theoretical frameworks for enabling a critical understanding of how reproductive rights are shaped by social structures and state institutions.",

          "The Government of India has implemented a range of policies to address sexual health and reproductive rights, with a particular focus on ensuring better, affordable healthcare for the impoverished, rural, and marginalized communities, including women.",
          "Building on the success of the first two National Health Policies (1983 and 2002), the 2017 policy was reintroduced to reinforce and expand the government's role in healthcare—covering areas such as health financing, technology, medical education, disease prevention, and human capital investment (Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, 2017). A major goal of this policy is to provide free primary healthcare services, especially in maternity, child, and adolescent health, by optimizing existing resources (World Health Organization: WHO, 2019). It sets targets to reduce maternal and infant mortality, increase life expectancy from 67.5 to 70 years by 2025, and improve disease prevention and awareness (Dahiya, 2018). By 2022, the maternal mortality rate dropped from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2017 to 97, and the infant mortality rate declined from 39 to 23 per 1,000 live births during the same period (Agrawal et al., 2024). ",
          "In 1966, the Shantilal Shah Committee recommended liberalizing abortion laws to reduce maternal deaths due to unsafe abortions. This led to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Bill, introduced in 1969 and enacted in 1971. The Act mandates that abortions must be conducted in government-approved facilities (legal Service India, n.d.). While the MTP Act has helped reduce unsafe abortions, barriers remain for poor and marginalized women. A report by the Centre for Reproductive Rights reveals that India still performs 8,000 unsafe abortions annually (Diamondstein, 2021). Unsafe abortions account for approximately 15,000 maternal deaths annually—about 8.9% of all such deaths. Only 25% of organized-sector abortion clinics are government-owned, with the remainder in the private sector. In Jharkhand, 82% of women are unaware that abortion is legal (Kohli, 2008), and around 190,000 adolescents undergo unsafe abortions without proper medical care, as 78% of procedures occur outside regulated facilities (Seth, 2022).",
          "The healthcare workforce shortage also affects service delivery. There is only one government physician for every 10,189 people, compared to the WHO recommendation of one per 1,000. Only 1,351 obstetricians and gynaecologists serve rural community health centres (Banerjee, 2022). While institutional deliveries increased from 39% in 2005 to 79% in 2015, 21% of births still occur at home (Mishra et al., 2021). The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), launched in 2005, aims to provide affordable, accessible healthcare in rural areas. Since 1990, India has seen an 83% reduction in maternal mortality, surpassing the global decline of 45% (Ministry of Health & Family Welfare-Government of India, n.d.). The Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) program, also part of NRHM, engages over a million trained volunteers to provide maternal care, immunization, and family planning services (Kuldeep, 2025).",
          "The Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), also launched in 2005, seeks to reduce maternal and infant mortality by offering financial incentives for institutional deliveries (Pillai, 2024). Despite its reach, disparities persist. Mothers from marginalized backgrounds often face economic and social barriers in accessing hospital care. SC/STs represent 37.6% of JSY beneficiaries, compared to 61.8% from non-SC/ST groups (Mishra, Veerapandian, et al., 2021). The 2015–16 report from the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) indicates that transgender individuals have the second-highest HIV prevalence among high-risk groups at 8.82%, largely due to systemic discrimination and limited access to healthcare.",
          "In 2013, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare launched the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) strategy. It aims to reduce maternal and child mortality through improvements in infrastructure, human resources, and cross-sectoral collaboration (Ministry of Health & Family Welfare-Government of India, n.d.)."

However, India’s public healthcare system faces significant challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, insufficiently trained personnel, and low investment. Despite improvements, rising costs due to private sector dominance hinder access for the poor and marginalized.",
          "The Indian judiciary has progressively recognized reproductive autonomy as part of personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. In the landmark Puttaswamy judgment, the Supreme Court upheld a woman's right to make reproductive choices. Similarly, in Suchitra Srivastava v. Chandigarh Administration, the court affirmed a woman’s right to bodily autonomy, dignity, privacy, and choice in pregnancy decisions (Mathur, n.d.). The 2017 ruling further recognized health as a fundamental right under Article 21, reaffirming reproductive autonomy and access to abortion. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020 restricts surrogacy to altruistic arrangements for Indian couples, aiming to eliminate exploitation in commercial surrogacy. Meanwhile, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 safeguards minor girls’ reproductive rights by ensuring legal abortion access in cases of abuse. According to NFHS-5, rural maternal mortality stands at 114 per 100,000 live births, compared to 87 in urban areas. About 20% of rural women lack access to safe abortion and modern contraception. Teenage pregnancies are recorded at 7.1% nationally (rural: 9.3%, urban: 4.2%) (Chandra, 2025). NFHS-3 data shows that 16% of girls aged 15–19 are mothers, and 46% were married before age 18. In Jharkhand, one in four teenage girls is already a parent. Alarmingly, 35% of Indian women report experiencing physical or sexual violence, and 54% believe spousal abuse is justified (Chowdhury, 2021)"

        paragraphs: [
          "The intersectional approach, as theorized by Kimberlé Crenshaw,  recognized how overlapping identities influence access to rights. (Crenshaw, 1991) Integrating some principles would align Indian policy more closely with the reproductive justice framework which will view reproductive rights not just as access to services but the freedom to make decisions about one’s body, family, and future. (Ross & Solinger, 2017) While reproductive health is part of the right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, it still requires stronger legal backing and better systems to protect these rights in real life (Srivastava v. Chandigarh, 2009). ",
          "India should bring a separate reproductive law that specifically protects the reproductive rights of women regardless of a woman’s caste, marital status, or background. This law should give women the legal right to decide whether they want to have children, when to have them, and how to manage their fertility. (Nisha Ranjan, 2025)  Access rules should be revised under the MTP Act. While the 2021 amendment extended abortion access for some women up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, decisions still heavily depend on doctors. (MTP Act, 2021) The law should trust women to make independent choices without needing multiple medical approvals (except in emergencies). Additionally, it should be made sure that all national laws and policies follow treaties like the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) alongwith setting up clear ways to check and fix any violations of maternal and reproductive rights. (UNHRC, 2024) To ensure this, independent monitoring and feedback systems should be set up with teams (including health experts, legal professionals, and members of civil society) at district or state levels that check whether hospitals and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) are following laws and policies related to sexual and reproductive health.  The bodily contestation theory emphasizes how women's bodies are sites of social and political control. (Bordo, 1993) Accordingly, policies must shift from provider-centric models to ones that prioritise women’s bodily autonomy in order to ensure their right to make informed and independent decisions about contraception, abortion, and maternal care free from any coercion or paternalistic interference. Judicial activism should be encouraged to actively protect sexual and reproductive health (SRH) rights. Public interest litigations (PILs) and past cases can help ensure that marginalized women are not denied essential services. Each state should appoint a dedicated SRH ombudsperson to handle complaints (particularly from adolescents) who seek care without parental consent or face caste-based discrimination in healthcare."

          "According to NFHS-5 (2020–21), only about 56.5% of currently married women (15–49 years) use modern contraceptive methods and knowledge about emergency contraception remains alarmingly low. (IIPS & ICF, 2021) These gaps illustrate the systemic failure to guarantee reproductive agency, especially among young and rural women. To change this:",
          "PHCs (Primary Health Centres) and smaller clinics should be equipped to offer not only pregnancy care, but provide full reproductive services i.e. safe abortion services, contraception, treatment of infections, and health education. (WHO, 2022) Medication abortion (using pills to terminate early pregnancies) should be made available at these centres as it doesn’t require advanced tools or hospitalization. For women who can't travel due to distance, cost, or restrictions, healthcare workers should deliver monthly door-to-door check-ups, especially in rural and tribal areas. Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) should be integrated into the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agenda through a ‘progressive universalism’ approach that prioritizes those most at risk, such as young, poor, Dalit, and tribal women, rather than merely extending services uniformly to middle-class populations. (WHO, 2022) Many healthcare providers such as Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) or Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) need training to be more empathetic and informed to understand the unique needs of adolescents or Dalit and tribal women. It should include respect for consent, privacy, and non-judgmental care.   There should be regular social audits and public meetings to check how well things are working. Civil society groups should be involved in reviewing gaps and making sure SPARSH (Sensitization, Prevention and Redressal of Sexual Harassment) rules are followed in healthcare. (MoHFW, 2021) Additionally, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, sexual and reproductive health services were often stopped. The government should stay prepared during emergencies and treat these as essential services even during crises to prevent more maternal deaths or unwanted pregnancies. (Ministry of Health, 2020) Most importantly, financial incentives should be directed with enough safeguards to ensure that care remains voluntary and of high quality. The government should allocate dedicated funds to set up adolescent-friendly SRH centers within Primary Health Centres (PHCs) that offer confidential services for menstruation, STIs, contraception, and mental health. To improve access to safe abortion, trained Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs) at PHC level should be allowed to prescribe Medication Abortion (MA) drugs under the MTP Rules. This step would significantly reduce stigma and eliminate the need for women to travel long distances for basic reproductive care. "

          "A key challenge is the normalisation of shame and silence around reproductive health in India particularly among unmarried women and gender minorities. Addressing this requires a cultural shift where bodily autonomy is not perceived as immoral but rather as essential to individual dignity and democracy.",
          "Many women and adolescents do not know their reproductive rights or are afraid to ask for services because of social stigma.  Rights-based education should be started by introducing Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) in schools and community learning centres. This means teaching about puberty, consent, menstrual health, contraception, and gender equality in age-appropriate ways which should be available to both girls and boys. (UNESCO, 2024) Awareness campaigns should be introduced in regional languages by using radio, TV, social media, and local public meetings to tell women about their rights under laws like the MTP Act, while also clarifying that unmarried women and rape survivors can legally access abortions. (MoHFW, 2021) Safe spaces should be created to report abuse or denial wherein healthcare centres should put up clear information about complaint systems in local languages. If a woman is denied care or treated badly, she should know whom to contact and how to get help.",
          "Rather than being utopian visions, these policies are doable within the infrastructure already available. For instance, expanding medication abortion pills is low-cost and can be done at the PHC level. District health offices already run monitoring visits which can be improved to focus on rights and treatment quality. Training and awareness programs already exist and they only need to include topics like consent, discrimination and inequality. (WHO, 2022) By focusing on real-life challenges, these suggestions help bridge the gap between paper policies and women's actual experiences. Most importantly, they make bodily autonomy and dignity a real part of India’s public health system and not just legal promises.",
          "Limitation and Implementation Challenges - While the proposed reforms are based on systems that already exist, putting them into action will need strong political support, enough funding, and better training, especially in rural areas where the health system is already stretched. Additionally, any changes in the law must take into account the possibility of social and cultural resistance. This is the reason it is equally important to invest in spreading awareness, educating people about their rights and involving communities in the process."

    conclusion: [
      "This paper investigates critically the ongoing discrepancy in the execution of India's reproductive health policies at the local level. Systemic barriers based on caste, class, gender, and geography still affect marginalized groups, especially Dalit, tribal women, and adolescents, even in the face of progressive legal frameworks like the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act and programs like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY). In India, health policy frequently gets trapped between technocratic planning and political inaction, as Dr. Ritu Priya points out, leading to inefficient service delivery. The authors point out that unsafe abortions continue to be a serious problem, contributing to over 15,000 maternal fatalities every year, primarily as a result of stigma and legal illiteracy (Shivani Nag & Flavia Agnes). ",
      "The study highlights the disparity between public and private sectors in reproductive healthcare, where social justice is subordinated to market-driven goals, resulting in unequal access. The results of primary surveys show a general lack of knowledge of schemes, prejudice against unmarried women, and obstacles such provider bias and privacy concerns. ",
      "To close the gap between policy and practice, it is suggested that rights-based education, institutional reforms, and enhanced legal responsibility be taken up. A case for a change toward empowering women's bodily autonomy, comprehensive sexuality education, and sensitive healthcare delivery, citing Kimberlé Crenshaw's intersectionality paradigm, is made. In order to ensure that everyone has meaningful access to sexual and reproductive health rights, the paper advocates for a comprehensive, inclusive strategy."

    abstract: [
      "The rapid digitalisation and expansion of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India have brought mixed outcomes, particularly for informal sector workers. The digital divide is a result of existing inequalities in socioeconomic status, geography, caste, and gender. While digitalisation has improved access in many areas, its benefits remain unevenly distributed. This paper investigates structural and systemic factors behind this gap and explores legal frameworks and the PPP model to promote financial inclusion.",
      "Using qualitative analysis of secondary data, this study finds that access to digital services remains uneven, for informal workers with low digital skills and sporadic access to the internet. It underscores spatial divide, limitations of the “one-size-fits-all” approach and the lack of legal protection in labour codes. It also reveals disparities within the informal sector, where MSME owners benefit from DPI but many workers remain excluded.",
      "Key recommendations include a universal legal definition for informal workers, rural digital awareness, government digital hubs under PPP model, and simplified user-centric e-portals designed with principle of privacy. Bridging the digital divide needs inclusive policy reforms to improve access to DPI across the Indian informal economy."

    intro: [
      "“Digital public infrastructure is not just about technology—it is about enabling equal access, empowering every citizen, and laying the digital rails for inclusive growth.” — Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys and founding Chairperson of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)",
      "A world that becomes increasingly interconnected is finding a potent force in its ability to influence the way that governments, businesses, and individuals transact and interact through Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). The most significant ones are the digital identity and payment system and the data exchange layers, which are creating preconditions of efficient and inclusive service provision at scale. They are materialised in India through Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker, e-SHRAM, and ONDC, which form the heart of digital governance and the economy of the country.",
      "To appreciate the actual effects of DPI is to look at how it interacts with India’s informal economy, which itself constitutes more than 90% of the labour force and almost 50% of its GDP. The unorganised sector in India is the consequence of certain structural limitations like low capital formation, as well as regional disparities and a failure of formal infrastructure to absorb the increasing labour. These are the workers who work in this unorganised sector—daily wagers, domestic help, street vendors, artisans, and micro-entrepreneurs—and they may not have a formal contract/right, legal protection, access to credit, or social security. That’s why they’re not immune from abuse, economic shocks, and generation span poverty. The emergence of DPI represents a chance to close such a historic gap, although its achievement is not automatic and homogenous. The most frequent obstacle is a digital divide, particularly the rural-urban, gender, and income-related ones. Although the mobile connectivity and smartphone penetration have been enhanced, the problem is that digital access and digital literacy are still skewed, especially among women and elderly and marginalised groups. This digital divide affects financial inclusion directly. The Indian fintech revolution has resulted in women still having limited access to digital payment systems, access to formal credit, and ownership of assets, highlighting the importance of the design of DPI to be gender-sensitive.",
      "Another factor behind the DPI story in India is a well-functioning model of public-private partnerships (PPP), where the government makes core infrastructure (e.g., Aadhaar and UPI), and private actors develop applications and services on top. This model makes innovation possible at scale and checks its oversight by the public. But to have any lasting effect on livelihoods, DPI should do more than just enable transactions. It is supposed to allow the informal workforce to get access to new markets (such as ONDC for the local sellers), employment opportunities, generate credit histories, and access government schemes through websites such as e-SHRAM.",
      "Meanwhile, a fast rate of digitisation of citizen information presents important legal and regulatory questions, especially in regard to data privacy and surveillance, informed consent, and risks of exclusion. Data localisation norms, grievance redressal systems, and the Personal Data Protection Act need to dynamically advance along with the implementation of DPI to safeguard the rights of the informal labour force. The following paper focuses on the multidimensionality of the interaction of DPI in reconstituting the informal economy of India. It examines the position of dominant industries in the informal space, e.g., retail, construction, domestic services, and gig work, and the impact that DPI has on their inclusion, productivity, and resilience. The study will examine the major policy interventions, usage patterns, and current obstacles in order to present practical solutions towards an inclusive digital future."

          "The aim of this research paper is to comprehensively examine the varying stages of digital transformation across the country, with an explicit concentration on the function and consequences of digital public infrastructure on various aspects of society, with special reference to the informal sector. Our questions seek to understand both the drivers and consequences of digital access and usage patterns, while also considering systemic elements within the DPI ecosystem. This report is guided by the following research questions.",
          "●How do socio-economic and contextual factors influence the patterns of access to and effective utilisation of digital public infrastructure by different informal sector subgroups, and what are the resulting effects on their outcomes in knowledge acquisition, well-being, financial inclusivity, and the livelihoods of workers under various informal sector arrangements?",
          "●To what extent do trends of privatisation, phantomization, and wealth accumulation within the Digital Public Infrastructure landscape, alongside the prevailing legal frameworks and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models, influence digital access and the ability of informal sector actors to leverage these technologies for their benefit, and how can these challenges be addressed?",
          "In line with the above-mentioned stratification hypothesis, we argue that variations in access to and use of technology are reproducing themselves, which in turn are exacerbating realworld disparities. This has restricted the ability of the digitally disadvantaged to access resources and fully reap the benefits of the virtual world."

          "UNDERSTANDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE",
          "OECD defines the digital divide as a gap across various socioeconomic levels in the use of ICTs and internet usage. It results from several factors, such as gender, affordability, location, and digital literacy. Only 31% of the rural population uses the internet, compared to 67% in urban areas (Oxfam India, 2022). Laskar (2023) shows an existing divide between urbanrural and intra-urban, causing limited digital access and technology-based skills, while Vaidehi et al. (2020) found low internet access, usage, and digital literacy in marginalised communities.",
          "Digitalisation has benefited some while excluding a large section of society (Dubey et al., 2024). These gaps persist despite government initiatives like the Digital India campaign, JAM, and UPI (ILO, 2024), particularly impacting the wages of informal workers (Sengupta et al., 2021).",
          "FINANCIAL INCLUSION",
          "Monetary policy becomes more effective through increased interest rate influence on economic transactions (Mehrotra & Yetman, 2015; Patra, 2021).",
          "According to Gupta et al. (2017), digital transformation can improve GDP and fiscal policy. At the 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad, PM Modi emphasised joint efforts by women and men for prosperity and development (Balasubramaniam et al. 2021).",
          "Inclusive financial services, as recognised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), are key to social security and poverty (Bhandari 2018).",
          "According to Ghosh and Bhattacharya (2019), financial innovations have expanded services for women and underprivileged individuals.",
          "REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS",
          "Maiti and Khari (2023) discovered that as a country uses more digital technologies, informal firms shrink and then grow again. The finest digital tools assist informal enterprises in becoming legitimate in countries with robust legislation. If laws are weak, digital tools may make it tougher for informal labourers to get work. If they feel observed, informal workers may avoid digital tools.",
          "In Puttaswamy v. Union of India, the court upheld Aadhaar but ruled that everyone has the right to privacy. The judicial system must respect digital privacy and dignity for DPI to be trusted.",
          "According to A. Panagariya (2022), existing social protection legislation ignores DPI and commends the India Stack, a combination of open APIs and digital public goods, for regulation. Current labour rules don't protect informal gig workers since they ignore DPI.",
          "Data protection and privacy are first and foremost about ensuring personal data is used with consent and kept within India. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 draft, based on the recommendations of the Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee, sets these rules, with the Data Protection Board of India investigating data breaches and imposing fines up to 250 crore.",

          "IMPACT ON LIVELIHOODS",
          "With the growth of technology, Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has risen as one of the determiners in enhancing the livelihoods of the informal workers in India. It has simplified the process of delivery of welfare programs and wage payments and minimised leakages of the transfer of benefits (Kshirsagar & Cleary, 2024).",
          "Indeed, ICRIER (2017) established that when Aadhaar is integrated with wage-paying systems, the underpayments and delays among workers have been materially reduced.",
          "With Aadhaar integration, the services of the middlemen were also minimised, and workers received government assistance and other necessary services directly (Muralidharan et al., 2020).",
          "DPI has also been beneficial to the stability of households, to better access the fundamental base of resources, including food and fuel (World Bank, 2018).",
          "Nevertheless, a part of the workforce still experiences an impediment caused by the ambiguity regarding the usage of the system or the cases of manipulation and misuse (Krishna, 2020).",

        heading: "METHODOLOGICAL OVERVIEW",
        paragraphs: [
          "The methodology used for conducting this analysis of this policy, “Bridging the Divide: DPI in the Informal Sector, is a hybrid and integrative approach that includes secondary, qualitative, and, to an extent, quantitative means to meet the ends to comprehensively analyse the intersection of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and the informal sector in India. The foundations of the study actually rest on the secondary research, where a broader range of existing literature, policy documents, legal frameworks, academic articles, and government reports were taken deep into account and were consulted. These include key sources such as Oxfam, World Bank assessments, and the landmark legislations & acts like the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023), the Aadhar Act, and the IT Act (2000) that helped & allowed to map the evolution of the DPI and its practical implications on the informal workers. Complementary to this is the qualitative analysis that helped deep dive into the structural and contextual realities of these informal sectors. Rather than just relying on the data, the study explores issues like digital exclusion; systemic marginalisation, which is based on caste and gender; exploitation by private players; the phantomization of data, i.e., through databases like e-Shram; and gaps in digital literacy. Legal judgements like Puttaswamy v. Union of India are analysed qualitatively to interpret how privacy rights and data governance influence trust and participation in the digital ecosystems. Furthermore, the study to some extent integrates the basic quantitative insights to validate its claims, using the statistics to reflect the extent of digital access and the economic impact of DPI. Overall, this mixed methodology enriches the study by ensuring that secondary data provides a macro-policylevel perspective, in which the qualitative interpretation adds depth to socio-economic and political realities, and picked quantitative data underscores the scale of digital disparities and economic outcomes. This mixed approach is particularly well suited for policy analysis in the Indian informal sector, where diversity on the ground level and structural inequalities demand more than a single-method investigation. The methodology effectively captures the complexity of the DPI’s impact, showing how interventions of technology are backed by robust institutional support. Hence, the methodology reflects not only the researchers’ intent to examine existing knowledge critically but also through a holistic lens."

        paragraphs: [
          "UNDERSTANDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE",
          "The digital divide is a result of existing socioeconomic inequalities in society. Though more visible in rural areas, it is also prevalent in urban spaces, showcasing inequality between resource-rich and under-resourced communities. This reveals that infrastructure alone, without inclusive policies, cannot bridge this divide.",
          "Marginalised communities remain excluded due to ingrained systemic barriers like castebased issues and digital literacy, widening the divide.",
          "Here the digital divide emerges as both a cause and a consequence of the societal divide. Its impact on the wages of the informal sector extends to family welfare, health, and education.",
          "The limited impact of initiatives like JAM and UPI shows disconnect in policy targets and implementation; without accountability and a holistic strategy involving the community, these initiatives risk deepening rather than bridging the divide.",
          "FINANCIAL INCLUSION",
          "The government and RBI have focused on financial inclusion by leveraging technology, improving infrastructure, and supporting financial literacy among informal sector workers and digitally excluded populations. Low-income populations hesitate to use DPI-enabled services due to tax concerns, which lower their financial activity in the formal economy, reducing their contribution to India’s GDP and economic development. For informal sector workers, financial inclusion must cover access to credit, insurance, and emergency funds.",
          "These steps ensure digital financial inclusion becomes a driver of equity, supporting sustainable livelihoods and enabling broader socio-economic development across underserved communities. Financial inclusion under DPI ensures that informal sector workers and low-income groups access essential financial services like savings, loans, and insurance efficiently and transparently. Digital ID systems simplify know your customer (KYC) procedure and reduce customer verification costs, allowing financial institutions to deliver affordable and efficient services to low-income and rural populations with minimal infrastructure. Senior citizens often lack digital knowledge, making it difficult for them to access DPI platforms like telemedicine or pension services, which increase their vulnerability to online fraud and misinformation during financial or insurance scheme linking. Women in rural areas face many barriers in digital finance, like limited skills, low device ownership, poor literacy, and lack of documentation.",
          "REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS",
          "The legal and regulatory framework of digital public infrastructure can be defined as the infrastructure that helps to reduce the time, money, and efforts of citizens, businessmen, and institutions for transparency, accountability, and inclusive participation.",
          "The Aadhar card allows individuals to prove their identity via biometrics such as fingerprints and eye retina and facilitates access to digital public services and government benefits. The Unique Identification Authority of India was established, and the Aadhaar Act was passed for governing, ensuring transparency, accountability, and issue resolution.",
          "The Payment and Settlement System Act was passed in 2007, and RBI regulations ensure operations, risk management, and licensing of payment providers. The RBI monitors transaction limits and business on boarding. Digital payment systems like UPI and Aadharlinked payment systems enable digital money transfers.",
          "IMPACT ON LIVELIHOODS",
          "Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) is also changing the way informal workers are supported in terms of their lives becoming easier in having access to welfare programs and employment-related information as well as crucial services that are provided by the government. Government initiatives such as authentication of Aadhaar cards and direct benefit transfers have also helped the government in ensuring timely payment of aid, as fewer individuals are required to mediate the payments. The e-Shram database and other similar ones have made it easier to map informal workers, particularly during emergencies like the COVID-19 one.",
          "Through its efficiency in delivery, DPI has enhanced transparency and accountability, which has facilitated the maintenance of basic income supplied to vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, even these advantages still have certain obstacles to implementing the developed system and accessing its services: augmented reality, limited digital skills, sporadic access to the internet, and hiccups that might lock numerous individuals out. DPI is most effective when combined with local recruitment, offline support, and support of institutions. Instead of being like a one-size-fits-all program, it is a platform that needs to be aligned to what workers are experiencing. How maximally DPI can reinforce livelihoods is eventually subject to the inclusiveness with which the program is fashioned and its efficiency anchored on the ground.",
          "STATUS OF INFORMAL WORKERS",
          "The informal sector in India is a very vast sector; it includes various forms of labour, workers, and small businesses that are not industrially formalised yet and operate in a very small area. There are various subgroups that have benefited from the DPI, but there are groups who are neglected or unable to utilise the service provided to them in the optimum manner. Small business owners benefited the most from the e-payment system; it gave them the sense of security to run their business from their home. But the informal sector does not only contain the small businesses; it also contains the vast labour sector, which includes all kinds of labourers (daily wage labourers, gig workers, street vendors, rickshaw pullers, glass industry workers, etc.) who are not literate or digitally illiterate. They are the people who face the difficulty of accessing digital forums the most. They are generally illiterate, come in under the poverty line, and have very minute access to various technological services. The digital inclusion of women, specifically for the women in rural areas, is significantly low and mostly linked to the socioeconomic barriers as well. While digital inclusion can prove to play an important role in women's social and economic upliftment, they face a significant amount of discrimination in access to technologies.",
          "PUBLIC- PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) MODEL",
          "According to the Government of India, the PPP is collaboration between public authorities and private entities for delivering infrastructure or services, with shared investment, risk, & responsibility.”",
          "The PPP model is evident due to the result of the scarce resources, as the government cannot fund and falls into deficit to meet the needs of India’s large population. PPP results in identifying the potential and performing effectively, giving back quality and quantity at the same time. What stands out is how the PPP model becomes human. It works at the best level where and when people know each other, where technology is elaborated in local languages, and where digital access is made less daunting. In a manner, it’s not just about raising infrastructure, but it’s about building comfort and confidence. The PPP model, if not regularised, can lead to exploitation, which mainly depends on who is providing it and where, which in turn can undervalue the significance of PPP in the informal sector.",
          "The PPP model supports the informal workers via hard and soft infrastructure, providing incentives but does not tend to take into consideration the marginalisation that led to illiteracy & backwardness. Also, where people often lack documents and stable addresses, the PPP model can feel patchy many a time."

          "•There should be a universal legal definition for the informal workers, for formal recognition, legal security and access to welfare schemes.",
          "•Organise awareness drives at the rural-level through Panchayats, ASHA workers, and Anganwadi workers for both men and women about the digital schemes and also identify the challenges faced by them to cater them accordingly.",
          "•Simplify e-portals and offer interface in various regional and local languages to cater to the mass public.",
          "•Establish government digital hubs under PPP model, specifically designed to provide digital services to those without smartphones or internet access. These hubs to be staffed with local language speaking trained personnel.",
          "•Emphasises the need for user-centric design and usability of digital services, involving user-friendly interfaces, clear instructions, and features that cater to the specific needs of rural populations.",
          "•The government should adhere to the principle of privacy by design, which entails considering privacy from the outset when developing any digital platform, including applications, websites, or other digital public infrastructure.",
          "A systematic approach is essential to bridge the digital divide in the country. The informal sector requires government attention from the initial stages of creating an online account to sustained access and inclusion."

    conclusion: [
      "This paper examines the persistent digital divide and the exclusion of informal sector workers from accessing Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India. Despite initiatives like Jan Dhan, UPI, and E-Shram, many informal workers remain excluded due to deep-rooted socioeconomic and structural barriers. The paper highlights how digital access can serve as useful measure to formalise the informal sector, making it more visible and connected.",
      "Using secondary data, this paper reveals how digital connectivity affects informal workers socioeconomically. While DPI has benefited MSME owners, large proportion of informal workers, particularly women in rural areas still face exclusion because of limited digital literacy, deep-rooted social norms, and infrastructural gaps.",
      "This paper argues for an inclusive, systematic policy approach to address these challenges. Key recommendations include introducing a universal legal definition for informal workers, expanding digital awareness programs-especially for women in rural areas, setting up local digital hubs through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, simplification of e-portals and adherence to principle of privacy by design. Future research should explore the rural–urban digital divide within the informal sector more deeply and apply quantitative methods to measure DPI’s impact over time.",
      "In conclusion, DPI must be viewed not only as technological advancement but as a driver of inclusive growth and social equity. If implemented equitably, it can help achieve Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG 1 (poverty eradication), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals). Its aim should be to build an inclusive society across the country—not just a digitalised economy.",

    abstract: [
      "This article studies the localization of climate action through the lens of National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and its implementation through the framework of Panchayat Raj Institutions aiming to understand how effectively climate change is being localized in In the context of SDGs 13(Climate Action), we focus on assessing the alignment between national climate goals and their reach into community-level initiatives. The idea behind this study is to uncover the potential of decentralized governance in building climate-resilient Panchayats. Using the qualitative research methods such as policy reviews, literature reviews and case studies from selected Panchayats, by analyzing the current state of NAPCC mission integration at the local level.",
      "It identifies three critical themes: (1) Climate Resilient Rural Development, (2) Policy and Institutional Synergies, and (3) Capacity Building and Finance. These themes guide the investigation into institutional, policy, and financial mechanisms that support or hinder effective climate action at the grassroots",
      "This study reveals that many communities find it difficult to make the climate action plans implemented in their local level effectively. However, there are some notable cases—like the integration of GPDP, Mission LiFE, and collaborations with initiatives such as MGNREGA—that demonstrate how teamwork can drive real progress. The paper concludes with some practical recommendations: enhancing training for local leaders, ensuring better coordination among departments, and involving everyone in the planning process to make climate action more impactful at the local level."

    intro: [
      "The national framework on climate change in India is based on the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) that outlines eight national missions aimed at promoting environmental sustainability and resilience to climate change. The NAPCC is strategic in its vision, but realizing that vision is contingent on its monocular application and incorporation into local actions. PRIs being the institutional levels responsible for rural development, are important agents of climate change governance.",
      "Nonetheless, there are issues related to poor access to resources, inadequate institutional capacity, and limited policy coherence that challenge this localization. The introduction has the aim of laying the framework for understanding how the climate change agenda, as outlined at the level of the national agenda, is then translated into actions by the Panchayats."

        heading: "Thematic Literature Review",
        paragraphs: [
          "Theme: – Climate Resilient Rural Development",
          "Rural India is on the frontline of climate change vulnerability. The majority of the rural population (more than 70%), for their livelihoods depend on agriculture and natural resources, are especially vulnerable with a degree of risk associated with more irregular weather events, insufficient water resources, land degradation and loss of biodiversity. Thus, climate resilient rural development represents more than a development challenge but also a question of climate justice, food security and sustainable national development over long timeframes.",
          "The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) provides a policy framework at the macro-level through 8 missions and their associated objectives, including the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), the National Water Mission (NWM) and the Green India Mission. At present, they are often not visible at the grassroots level and aligned to local institutions, and thus rarely act as vehicle for transformative change in rural society.",
          "Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) provide a particular institutional opportunity for decentralized and participatory climate action. They derive their legitimacy from the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, and are legislated to create and execute development plans for socio-economic development and social justice. If we embedded those objectives as part of the NAPCC in the Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) then community endorsed resilience strategies could facilitate local solutions to these vulnerabilities.",
          "The 'Climate Resilient Livelihoods' project in Malkangiri district, Odisha involved a collaborative partnership between Grams Panchayats, UNDP and the Odisha State Climate Change Cell. For PRIs, participatory vulnerability assessments in their communities helped to identify issues of concern, including cyclical floods and crop failures, and adaptive solutions, including elevated grain banks, saline first paddy varieties and decentralized solar irrigation. All of this was supported by relevant components of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and National Water Mission (NWM) which was an effective example of vertical integration connecting the policy with planning at the local sub-district level.",
          "Likewise, in Kolar, Karnataka, the Panchayat implemented water budgeting and demand-side groundwater management with guidance from the National Water Mission “Catch the Rain” campaign. This example shows how PRI-led microplanning can be cumulatively harnessed to meet mission targets on water efficiency.",
          "Nonetheless, structural barriers remain:",
          "Lack of climate literacy among Panchayat m",
          " Lack of local climate data and early warnings",
          " Rigid scheme-oriented funding that does not allow for integrated resilience planning",
          " Weak convergence across sectors (agriculture, forestry, water, rural development).",
          "The next pivotal step is to create 'Climate-Resilient Panchayat Frameworks' at the state level, with allocated budgets, capacity development modules, and data dashboards around district-specific vulnerabilities. The Climate Resilient Rural Development will also enhance the climate action or SDG 13 relationship as there is greater recognition of the importance of local action within the global space. The continued commitment of India to support climate-resilient communities through Mission LiFE and the Localizing SDGs Campaign can further bolster the ability of Gram Panchayats (GPs) to scale adaptation responses.",
          "Theme:  Policy and Institutional Synergies",
          "Successful climate governance in India relies on ongoing coordination between policy regimes and institutions. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), and their eight mission based approaches, creates strategic ideas on how to address climate challenges. The implementation part however, depends on how well it blends with State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) and becomes part of the local governance frameworks, especially through Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). This sensitive link, sometimes called policy and institutional synergy is essential to helping national goals falls into activities that have local relevance.",
          "One of the major challenge is the gap between center policy making and local implementation. While Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) give a mechanism for localizing climate priorities, poor coordination and inadequate technical assistance often limit their practical implementation. Many a times Panchayats are not fully utilized, despite the fact that Constitution have given role of panchayats separately for local development. Looking at the positive side, local developments have taken few steps, models such as watershed programs and behavior change initiatives merged with MGNREGA like programs exemplify the benefits of institutional synergy. These initiatives shows that if ministries, departments, and Panchayats work together closely, climate action can become more effective and inclusive.",
          "In order to augment this synergy, there is a need to institute formal coordination mechanisms at different levels. This must involve central ministries (such as MoEFCC and DST), state climate cells, and local government institutions. Providing access to climate information and financial resources, in particular through connecting funds from schemes such as PMKSY and Jal Jeevan Mission, is also essential. India is an agrarian country we know this agriculture happens in village, agriculture is the most crucial and ignorant in terms of taking it as a career. This is also due to no prominent outcome which ultimately linked to climate actions. Our actions, how we take care of the climate is given back to us, so it is utmost important to make local community familiar with climate actions and policies made for it causes.",
          "India has achieved its position in international climate discussions and debates, internal unity is important. Locals community should be aware of the policies made for them under climate action plans and implementation of those policies should be done effectively. Its of utmost importance to recognize panchayats, as actors and participants in the stakeholders participatory framework, rather than simply just implementers. At the end, the success of climate resilience at the grassroots level rests on enabling integrated policy interventions and institutional coordination to enable actor and beneficiary to enable to take ownership of their own adaptations initiatives.",
          "Theme: Capacity Building and Finance",
          "Building the capacity of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and enabling access to climate finance is crucial for converting the frameworks outlined in the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) into actions at the local level. PRIs manage over 250,000 Gram Panchayats that interact directly with almost 65% of the rural population in India (MoPR, 2020). Yet, with this powerful base, they are not able to achieve much with climate change, largely due to a shortage of technical knowledge and institutional assistance, as well as a lack of access to financial resources.",
          "Recent analysis finds, only 12% of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs), built climate resilience into their plans, and over 70% of Panchayats have never accessed climate specific funding (NIRDPR, 2021). Although GPDP or other funding mechanisms exist, such as the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), MGNREGA and PM-KUSUM, PRI participation is limited, due to their lack of understanding and skills to mobilize climate finance (MoEFCC, 2023).",
          "Capacity building is a tremendous need. A survey done by NIRDPR (2019) reported that only 10% of Primary Revenue Institutions (PRI) facilitators had received any form of training on climate adaptation (NIRDPR, 2020). PRIs cannot access funds such as the ₹364.35 crore NAFCC (MoEFCC, 2023), or take advantage of schemes under the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) without training on proposal writing, budgeting, and co-ordination between departments. For example, in PM-KUSUM which aims for 30.8GW solar capacity for rural areas where the scheme is not fully exploited due to incomplete integration at sub-state levels (MNRE, 2022).",
          "Working alongside NGOs, private Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actors and experts in the field can lead to lessons that improve climate adaptations at the grassroots. Two pilot programs in Odisha and Maharashtra demonstrated a 25–30% increase in the proportion of climate-related spending in the budgetary allocation and enabled a better relationship with communities (Vij et al., 2024).",
          "Since India suffers $87 billion in economic losses due to climate disasters every year (World Bank, 2021), investing in the PRIs is a compelling strategy. As greater training, access to financial resources and inclusive planning is developed, PRIs can take the transformational lead in locally-driven sustainable climate action."

          "· There is almost no incorporation of climate-related vulnerabilities (like drought/flood risks) into the planning and fund allocation, which, as sad as it sounds, makes the proposal less investable or productive",

The successful pathways and models, like climate-sensitive GPDPs and interdisciplinary convergence (E.g watershed management through MGNREGA) proved that structured and quality capacity and participatory governance can work. The analysis suggests that Panchayats can be conveners of climate adaptation when provided relevant tools, training and funds."

    conclusion: [
      "Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) act as the agents of local climate action. Localizing climate action through PRIs is not merely a governance issue, it is an evolution needed in India’s climate framework. This report shows that, in spite of the NAPCC laying out a well-planned national strategy, this does not translate into action at the local level, partly due to issues like fragmentation of institutions for climate action, capacity, disjointed pathways to funds, and limited community engagement.",
      "The findings indicated a significant shift in the climate governance architecture of India away from a top-down policy delivery model towards building bottom-up resilience. The Panchayats must not only be perceived as implementers of climate action, but as recognized climate decision-makers. For this milestone to materialize, state and central governments have to work to catalyze knowledge transfer and to build technical capacity, with participatory governance models that are forged from the local experience.",
      "To achieve the tipping point of SDG 13 (Climate Action) at scale is to ensure that the lowest tiers of governance are empowered. With climate considerations integrated into Local plans and PRIs as active actors in the climate response, India will be on a pathway to building resilient rural communities that are ready not only to survive the climate crisis, but to spearhead effective resistance against it."

    abstract: [
      "Migration is a fundamental aspect of human history, driven by the search for survival, security, and opportunity. From the earliest movements out of East Africa to contemporary global flows, migration patterns have always reflected deeply embedded political, economic, and environmental dynamics. In the modern era, migration is shaped by “push” factors such as conflict, poverty, and climate change, and “pull” factors like economic opportunity and safety. However, these movements are not merely personal choices—they symbolize persistent global inequalities, particularly between the Global North and South. Statistics reveal that while 37% of migration occurs between Southern nations, corridors such as Mexico–U.S. and Africa–Europe underscore the influence of geopolitical alliances, policy disparities, and entrenched systemic inequalities.",
      "The study of U.S. migration policy offers a powerful lens into these broader forces. Recent years have witnessed profound shifts, especially under the Trump administration, which implemented sweeping rollbacks on humanitarian protections. Policies like the “Zero-Tolerance” family separation initiative, the “Remain in Mexico” protocol, travel bans targeting Muslim-majority and African countries, and narrowing of asylum eligibility marked a stark departure from prior commitments to refugee and asylum rights. These measures resulted in widespread family separation, increased deportations, and fueled an atmosphere of fear and exclusion for migrants and asylum seekers.",
      "Moreover, the Trump administration’s approach has had long-term reverberations—weakening institutional capacity, fueling backlogs, and politicizing immigration agencies. Even as the Biden administration has attempted to reverse some of these policies, structural barriers and the legacy of enforcement-first strategies persist, complicating efforts toward humane migration justice and reform. The implications extend beyond the U.S., altering global attitudes and contributing to a backlash against multilateral cooperation on migration issues. As migration remains a key site of contestation and negotiation, achieving genuine change will require not just policy reversal but structural transformation to address the deep-rooted inequalities, uphold human rights, and rebuild trust in migration governance."

          "The provided research overviews the multifaceted and complex dynamics of global migration, focusing on the U.S. and its policy shifts. The introduction and core findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding migration, highlighting it as a historical constant shaped by push and pull factors, but also as a reflection of deep-seated global inequalities. The literature, including works by Georgiana Florentina Tataru and Jennifer Hyndman, positions migration within a geopolitical context, with disparities between the Global South and North driving significant flows. The mention of the Migration Policy Institute’s statistics on South-South versus South-North migration corridors reinforces this point, underscoring the influence of economic disparities and geopolitical alliances. The review of Trump-era policies, drawing on various sources like AP News and The Guardian, provides a detailed account of specific measures such as the Zero-Tolerance and Remain in Mexico policies. These sections emphasize the severe humanitarian consequences of these policies, including family separations and the erosion of asylum protections. The Long-Term Legacy and DEI implications sections extend this analysis, citing sources like the Brookings Institution and the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) to argue that these policies have had a lasting, detrimental impact on institutional capacity and the principles of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The final section, International Legal Frameworks, broadens the scope to international relations, detailing how U.S. policies influenced other countries and weakened global cooperation on migration, with references from Amnesty International and the American Immigration Council. Overall, the literature collectively paints a picture of migration as a political and social phenomenon, deeply affected by policy choices that have far-reaching humanitarian and international consequences.

        heading: "Core Findings",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Politics of Migration: ",
          "Migration is as old as humanity itself, but it has always been rooted in survival, whether it is for food, security, or opportunity. From early human movement out of East Africa to the transatlantic slave trade, migration has long been shaped by political, economic, and environmental factors. ",
          "Today, migration refers to the movement of people within and across borders, driven by “push” factors (conflict, poverty, climate change) or “pull” factors (economic opportunity, safety). But migration is not merely individual, but it reflects deep structural inequalities between the Global South and Global North. World-systems theory explains how core countries prosper at the expense of peripheral ones, fueling South-North migration and inequalities. It is important that we have a clear understanding of global migration as not just the movement or mobility from Global South to the Global North but a more complex system shaped by history, geopolitics and economic disparities. ",
          "The Migration Policy Institute states that South-South migration accounts for 37% of global migration, followed by South-North (35%), North-North (19–23%), and North-South (6%). Migration corridors like Mexico to the U.S. or Africa to Europe, which has continuously highlighted the geopolitical alliances preferences and the various inequalities. The Henley Passport Index shows vast disparities in travel freedom across countries, detailing how one's predetermined origin determines their travel liberty, with many countries in the Global South remaining restricted from going to all destinations. Visas favour the wealthy and educated while criminalizing other migrants. ",
          "Migration policies also reveal a moral complexity in global immigration. Under the Trump administration, U.S. policies, for instance, have welcomed white immigrants (i.e. 59 white South Africans accepted in 2025) while criminalizing migrants from Latin America and Africa (PBS News, 2025; Al Jazeera, 2025; DW, 2025). Family reunification processes were disrupted, and travel bans were implemented for citizens of several Muslim-majority and African countries. These policies were subject to legal challenges and were briefly reversed and reinstated across the Trump and Biden administrations. The use of tactics by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), such as mass raids and detention without legal counsel, has been criticized by organizations like Human Rights Watch. Their findings suggest that enforcement has disproportionately targeted Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals, raising questions about compliance with SDG 10, Target 10.7, which aims to facilitate safe and responsible migration. This raises a crucial question: where is the line between national security and the principles of justice and human rights? ",
          "Ultimately, migration is a geopolitical issue, where countries use immigration policies to shape alliances, economic strategies, and foreign policy. Borders and immigration policies are not neutral; they reflect a nation's stance on refugee acceptance, visa approval, and the travel freedom of migrants from the Global South. These borders are often racialized and militarized, reflecting deep-seated biases based on a migrant's wealth and country of origin. While SDG 10 seeks to reduce these gaps, current migration frameworks often reinforce them, leaving the American Dream more of a myth than a reality for many. "

        heading: "Asylum and Refugee Policy Rollbacks under Trump",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Trump-era rollbacks on asylum and refugee protections marked a sharp departure from longstanding U.S. humanitarian commitments. A centerpiece of this shift was the “Zero-Tolerance” policy, which led to mass family separations at the southern border. Intended as a deterrence strategy, it resulted in thousands of children being forcibly separated from their families. Subsequent court findings and psychological research highlighted enduring mental health effects such as PTSD, anxiety, and disrupted attachment—often persisting long after reunification. ",
          "The “Remain in Mexico” policy (Migrant Protection Protocols) further intensified the crisis by requiring asylum seekers—including vulnerable families—to wait in dangerous, unsanitary camps along the U.S.–Mexico border while their claims were processed. Many were denied legal representation, severely undermining their right to due process. Simultaneously, policies denying claims based on gang or domestic violence and restricting access for migrants who traveled through third countries further narrowed asylum eligibility. ",
          "Additionally, the administration drastically slashed refugee admissions and enforced travel bans that targeted several Muslim-majority and African countries, even attempting to block refugees already cleared for resettlement. Many of these actions were blocked by courts, reaffirming the primacy of congressional mandates over executive overreach. Legal challenges also arose over expedited removals and mass arrests of asylum seekers. ",
          "These policies drew sharp criticism from human rights organizations, legal experts, and the public. Surveys now show that 79% of Americans support immigration and favor more humane reforms. Critics argue that the rollbacks were less about national security and more about advancing an ideologically driven, racialized immigration agenda. ",
          "Ultimately, these measures reshaped U.S. asylum and refugee policy, raising urgent questions about executive power, legal protections, and America’s global role in upholding human rights. The legal and moral battles sparked during this era continue to influence contemporary immigration reform discourse. "

        heading: "The U.S.–Mexico Border Crisis: ICE and Deportation",
        paragraphs: [
          "The study of contemporary American politics and policy confirms that borders do indeed matter. In the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States closed its land borders and airspace, asserting control over US territory while concomitantly disrupting continental trade relations. This event highlighted the need to develop “smarter” border security policies that would allow goods to continue to flow freely. Given the recent prominence of US–Mexico border security in American electoral politics, and given that cognate issues such as immigration policy and defense spending have been researched extensively, it is surprising that public opinion research has paid little attention to America's borders. Even though scholars have noted that the map-image of the state and the lines that demarcate the limits of state territory are imprinted on public consciousness. The dynamics and scale of migration in and throughout the Americas have changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. Millions of migrants and displaced people are arriving every year to the U.S.-Mexico border, hailing not just from Mexico and northern Central America, but also from countries further south and from across the globe.Although the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, likely contributed to a significant drop in immigration that year, undocumented immigration at the US-Mexico border surged and broke records in subsequent years, with unauthorized border crossings reaching over two million in both 2022 and 2023. So far, in 2024, encounter numbers have decreased overall, but they remain high for certain countries. In the first five months of the year, CBP agents encountered more than nine hundred thousand migrants and asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. The majority hailed from just six countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, and Colombia, in descending order. A 2022 UN International Organization for Migration survey found that 90 percent of Mexican migrants left the country due to violence, extortion, or organized crime. The United States and Mexico have historically cooperated on countering organized crime, but during the six-year term of outgoing Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s federal government often took a hands-off approach to cartels and gangs, allowing them to expand their territorial presence. Meanwhile, bilateral security cooperation has faltered. "

        paragraphs: [
          "The Trump administration's immigration policies left a lasting mark on the American system, systematically dismantling humanitarian protections and aggressively expanding enforcement. Measures like the zero tolerance policy, which led to family separations at the border, the Remain in Mexico program, and the broad application of the public charge rule, were designed to deter immigration and create a more precarious existence for undocumented individuals in the U.S. (Hacking Law Practice, n.d.). This period saw a dramatic increase in deportations and a deliberate erosion of due process for asylum seekers, fostering an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty within immigrant communities nationwide (NILC, 2025). ",
          "Upon assuming office, the Biden administration pledged to reverse these restrictive policies and move towards a more humane and orderly immigration system. Indeed, Biden halted border wall construction, rescinded the controversial travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, and affirmed protections for DACA recipients (American Journal of International Law, n.d.). However, a complete reversal has proven difficult. While some policies were swiftly overturned, others, like the institutional capacity for expedited deportations and deeply embedded enforcement mechanisms, have been harder to dismantle. The Biden administration has, at times, faced pressure to maintain aspects of the previous administration's stricter border control, as demonstrated by its recent executive order to shut down the border if crossings exceed a certain threshold (White House Briefing, 2024). ",
          "The enduring impact of the Trump era extends beyond individual policies to the institutional damage inflicted upon agencies such as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Staffing reductions, a focus on enforcement over service, and the politicization of immigration processes have resulted in backlogs and diminished the capacity for fair and efficient case adjudication (Brookings Institution, 2025). This institutional scarring presents a significant obstacle to the future of migration justice—a framework that champions the rights, dignity, and fair treatment of all individuals, regardless of their migratory status (Human Rights Law Centre, n.d.). ",
          "Moving forward, achieving genuine migration justice demands not only the reversal of harmful policies but also a fundamental rebuilding of trust and capacity within the immigration system. It necessitates addressing the root causes of migration, investing in humane reception and processing, and establishing accessible pathways to legal status. Without a concerted effort to repair the institutional damage and prioritize human rights, the shadow of Trump-era policies will continue to loom large, complicating efforts to build a truly just and equitable immigration system.

          "Policy Landscape ",
          "Policies like the end of safe passage, the mass deportations with reduced oversight by courts, have created humanitarian crises and exclusion of vulnerable groups seeking asylum or refuge. The elimination of categorical humanitarian protections such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and DACA leave populations with long-lasting community ties on the margins while ending direct support for victims of violence and persecution. The use of ideological vetting of visa applicants closes the door on those whose prospective entry is based on an assumption of their political stances and threatens civil liberties for those fleeing from authoritarian regimes or other forms of oppression. ",
          "DEI Implications ",
          "These actions reflect a dismantling of DEI values that have shaped U.S. immigration over the last few decades. By limiting not only who can enter the U.S., but also who is provided any of the protections afforded by the U.S., the administration rolled back momentum toward the goal of increasing racial, ethnic, and ideological diversity.

          "As a result of Trump’s harsh migration policies, a number of countries have put in place similar migration policies that also serve to discriminate against migrants and hamper their welfare. These countries’ policies sometimes differ in the sense that some of these policies are a result of direct compulsion by the US government, while some others are simply in existence due to the ideological similarities between Trump and the countries’ heads of state.  ",
          "For example, the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in 2019, were pressured by the Trump administration to sign what were called “safe third country agreements” (Amnesty International, 2020). These agreements, one could say, formed part of these three countries’ migration policy as they were in essence, supposed to open their borders and let in thousands of deportees (who are citizens of the other countries) from the United States. Thankfully, the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, stopped the agreement from being implemented, although, that with Guatemala was put into effect for some months(American Immigration Council, 2021). On the other hand, countries with right-leaning governments such as Hungary, Italy, Germany, Austria have followed the lead of Trump and put in place similarly harsh migration policies or have engaged in Trump-like anti-immigration rhetoric.  ",
          "Asides from influencing specific countries, Trump has also done damage to existing international norms and frameworks. From the 2017 decision to end US participation in the Global Compact on Migration (GCM) which dealt a big blow to global efforts towards multilateralism in global migration policy decisions, to views concerning undocumented migrants which serve to criminalize them and associate them with violence (Chavez, et al., 2023). This has made the efforts of well-meaning governments and institutions a lot less effective as many people in the global north are becoming anti-immigration.  ",
        ]
      }
    ],
    conclusion: [
      "The research makes it clear: migration is not merely a logistical challenge but a profound human story, one deeply scarred by policy choices. The Trump administration's measures—from Zero-Tolerance family separations to the Remain in Mexico protocols—did more than just change laws; they actively dismantled humanitarian protections, inflicting lasting trauma and widespread suffering. These policies were not isolated events but were born from a geopolitical landscape of deep global inequality, where the Global North's prosperity often comes at the expense of the Global South. The reverberations of this era continue to echo. The institutional damage to agencies like USCIS and ICE has created a backlog of cases and fostered a climate of fear that persists today. This legacy complicates every attempt at reform, making the pursuit of a humane and just immigration system an uphill battle. Furthermore, these actions set a dangerous precedent on the international stage, weakening global cooperation and encouraging other nations to adopt similar anti-immigration stances. Ultimately, this period serves as a stark reminder that policy decisions have immense human consequences. Moving forward requires more than simply reversing past mistakes. It demands a fundamental commitment to migration justice—a vision that addresses the root causes of displacement, rebuilds trust in our institutions, and affirms the inherent dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their origin. Without this transformation, the shadow of past policies will continue to loom, making the American Dream a hollow promise for those who seek it most. "

    abstract: [
      "Accountability, rule of law and trust are at a continuous turbulent state that serve as the foundation of peace, justice and strong institutions categorised as the SDG 16. The inconsistency of such factors contributes to the global polycrisis of instability, birthing corruption and mismanagement. Thus, with such an environment conjured, institutions cannot mandate sustainable cities and communities of SDG 11, which ultimately break down the vital state-citizen relationship. Continuously, quantitative data research has revealed that the introduction of integrating information and communications technology (ICT) into the political realm will promote transparency, reinforce better trust mechanisms, and contribute to anti-corruption attempts. This particular paper explored two different regions, India and European countries executing the transformation of e-governance while revealing the extent of successes of maintaining both SDG 16 and SDG 11 goals as well as the challenges faced by both regions. It is imperative to understand that strong institutions and the performance style in which to manage their unique society have not been perfected, for there are always different multifaceted factors such as circumstances presented by histories of the regions as well as the dynamics instilled and practiced by the government and people based on preferences to use. Thus, with expectations, functioning governing bodies should be able to sustain their societies, ensure transparent justice and safety, and curate mandates for the betterment of the civil. Thus, this paper concludes such findings of the specific method of integrating ICTs in attempts to bridge the existing disconnect experienced by multiple institutions."

    intro: [
      "It has become increasingly clear lately that in the context of rapid urbanization, accountability, openness, and trust from society are becoming critical for city authorities (Harkness & Katz, 2016; Pickup, 2024). Cities, as key centers of administrative and demographic life, often face such problems as, for example, corruption, lack of transparency, and alienation of citizens from decision-making. Undoubtedly, this not only weakens the democratic foundations of city governance but also reduces its effectiveness (Mupandanyama, 2023; Transparency International, n.d.).",
      "It is our deep conviction that Goals 16 and 11 of the Sustainable Development Agenda, aimed at ensuring \"peace, justice, and strong institutions\" and “sustainable cities and communities,” respectively (United Nations, 2015; United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, n.d.), are particularly relevant in this context. The main thing is that the first emphasizes the importance of combating corruption, increasing transparency, and engaging citizens at all levels of government, and the second one reinforces it in the more communal context. Namely, the aforementioned task of SDG 16 is especially important in cities, where the interaction between citizens and government is most direct and intense. Although this goal is global, we believe that achieving it requires local solutions, as each city has its own unique institutional, political, and cultural characteristics that influence the implementation and reception of transparency initiatives.",
      "Another challenge in city governance is the bureaucratic procedures and often inconsistent accountability systems that city authorities are trying to combat. Of course, such institutional deficiencies only increase public mistrust, especially among vulnerable and marginalized groups who feel excluded from decision-making processes (Bertsou, 2019). In countries like India, institutional closures are often rooted in colonial administrative systems and are exacerbated by a lack of resources and uneven development of digital infrastructure (Panda & Kumar, 2025; Vision IAS, 2024). At the same time, in many European cities, the decline in trust is not so much due to corruption as to the gap between government actions and the daily needs of the population (Bertsou, 2019).",
      "As a response to these challenges, digital governance is gaining popularity. It is part of the world's transition to the sixth technological paradigm and, in the urban context, uses open databases, blockchain technologies, and platforms for citizen feedback. The long-term use of these tools in some cities and countries has already proven that they can improve governance by increasing transparency and inclusiveness, which, in turn, strengthens public trust in government, simplifies access to information, and optimizes service delivery (OECD, 2020; World Bank, 2021).",
      "However, it is obvious that the effectiveness of such digital solutions strongly depends on the specific conditions in which they are implemented. For example, the cities of Tallinn and Helsinki have made impressive progress in the digitalization of governance thanks to significant investments in sustainable technologies and high digital literacy of the population (Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, 2022; Government of Finland, n.d.; UN-Habitat, 2020; UN-Habitat et al., 2022). On the other hand, cities in India, despite attempts to introduce anti-corruption platforms (Nandy and Kumar, 2025), face problems of digital inequality and bureaucratic resistance (Panda and Kumar, 2025)."

          "Despite the significant potential of digital tools, a gap between the promise of technological solutions and the reality remains in urban governance around the world. This problem gives rise to a key issue known as the ‘transparency paradox.’ One leading view explains this paradox through the lens of instrumental incentives: corrupt or institutionally weak governments voluntarily join transparency initiatives not so much out of a genuine desire for reform but to gain reputational benefits such as access to international aid or increased political legitimacy (David-Barrett & Okamura, 2013). However, this reputational approach is not the only explanation. An alternative view shifts the focus from external incentives to internal dynamics, arguing that pressure from below is often the key driver of change. According to this approach, an active and organized civil society can force governments to increase transparency by using international initiatives as a tool for increasing domestic accountability (Isaksson, 2015). In this case, the main motivation is not the pursuit of international approval but the result of domestic political struggle.",
          "This theoretical dilemma directly affects our comparative analysis. In Indian cities, the adoption of digital platforms can be both a façade for external benefits and a concession to internal pressures, while ill-considered technology adoption risks creating digital inequalities (Panda & Kumar, 2025; Bertot et al., 2010). In European cities, even bottom-up reforms face an “e-governance paradox,” where technological solutions do not automatically increase trust (Otieno & Omwenga, 2016).",
          "A key research challenge, therefore, is the lack of understanding of which of these drivers—external reputational gain or internal civic pressure—and in what combination, determines the trajectory and success of digital governance in different institutional contexts.",
          "To address this multifaceted challenge, this study sets out to undertake a number of interrelated objectives. First, the paper aims to analyze the theoretical foundations underlying digital governance as a tool for enhancing transparency and trust. Building on this foundation, the study will proceed to its main objective: conducting an in-depth comparative analysis of specific digital governance initiatives in selected cities in India and Europe.",
          "The third objective is to assess the actual impact of these initiatives on the level of institutional transparency, accountability, and citizen trust. Finally, the findings of this study are concluded by pointing out the spheres of development of contextually informed recommendations for policymakers and practitioners on how to better use digital tools to strengthen urban governance."

          "The transparency and accountability of urban institutions are essential to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 16, which focuses on reducing corruption and building effective, inclusive institutions. In response to persistent governance challenges, cities have increasingly turned to digital tools—such as open data platforms and participatory applications—to address institutional gaps and rebuild public trust. This literature review highlights key areas of focus, including anti-corruption mechanisms in urban India and Europe, the role of digital tools in promoting citizen trust, and comparative frameworks that support cross-regional policy learning.",
          "Digital Anti-Corruption Mechanisms",
          "In Indian cities, there are digitized service delivery focused on reducing petty corruption. An example is Karnataka's e-Governance projects that demonstrated a reduction of bribery and increased efficiency, especially in licensing and municipal services (Chakraborty & Pandey, 2020). In Mumbai, transparency portals enabled real-time public access to civic contracts, increasing public audit interventions by almost 50% (Bose & Dey, 2022). Despite having an improvement, scholars still support that these tools only benefit urban elites and so hinder equitable access especially in peri-urban areas (Kumar, 2023).",
          "European cities have leveraged more advanced technological environments to integrate anti-corruption tools. For example, Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, has a blockchain-based public contract system that offers unchangeable records, reducing procurement fraud risks (Tatar & Kalvet, 2021). Moreover, Helsinki, capital of Finland, has an open Ahjo platform that enhances transparency by providing real-time legislative data, strengthening public scrutiny (Lindgren et al., 2019). Critically, institutional readiness influences its success, not only technology indicating advanced digital systems fail where institutional accountability strategies are weak (Tummers et al., 2022). This highlights a research contrast between European and Indian urban governance outcomes.",
          "Public Trust and Participatory Technology",
          "Digital participation has emerged as a tool for building trust. Public trust in Indian cities remains divided as the platform like MyGov struggles with inclusivity and at the same time encourages civic dialogue (Sharma & Bawa, 2021). The exclusion of marginalized groups that face digital literacy barriers and low-income groups risks deepening existing governance divides in urban areas.",
          "On the other hand, European cities stress on participatory governance where everyone is required to take part in public decision making. For instance, Amsterdam’s Open Stad and Helsinki’s Decidim are proof that transparent and inclusive citizen and noncitizen engagement correlates with higher institutional trust (Linders et al., 2023). However, Bannister and Connolly (2021) argue that institutional action on citizen feedback is required for information access. Therefore, to build trust, transparency initiatives must be coupled with good governance. This study is significant in India, where rapid urbanization outgrows institutional response.",
          "Comparative Urban Governance and Gaps in the Literature",
          "In India, the Smart Cities Mission has emphasized the modernization of infrastructure and the introduction of digital platforms like the India Urban Data Exchange and Mahiti Kanaja to promote transparency in public service delivery. However, many of these tools function in a top-down manner, often driven by state or national agencies rather than city-level democratic engagement (Kumar & Prakash, 2019). ",
          "In contrast, European cities tend to frame digital governance as a citizen-centered process. For instance, Amsterdam’s City Data Lab and the “Right to Challenge” initiative empower citizens not only to access data but also to actively shape local policy outcomes (Linders et al., 2023). These initiatives reflect a governance culture grounded in subsidiarity, where municipal institutions are granted considerable autonomy in decision-making and innovation. Additionally, platforms like Helsinki’s open budgeting system and Tallinn’s blockchain-based registries are examples of how technological design is aligned with broader institutional trust mechanisms (European Commission, 2022).",
          "From a theoretical lens, the principal-agent model helps frame how digital tools reduce information asymmetry between citizens (principals) and public officials (agents), thereby curbing opportunities for corruption (Janssen et al., 2012). Similarly, the trust-as-legitimacy theory posits that trust emerges not just from procedural openness but from the consistent responsiveness of institutions (Bannister & Connolly, 2021). Applying these frameworks comparatively, however, reveals that even technologically advanced platforms can fail when the institutional culture resists citizen empowerment—a challenge seen in both Indian and certain European cases.",
          "Despite a growing body of work on digital governance and urban innovation, there is a clear gap in comparative, cross-regional analysis. Most studies focus either on single-city innovations or national-level digital programs, without adequately linking municipal strategies in the Global South and North. Few have investigated how cities operationalize SDG 16 targets, particularly in relation to transparency and trust, using real-world case studies. This paper contributes to closing that gap by providing a comparative review of selected Indian and European cities, examining not only the tools they deploy but also the institutional ecosystems that enable or constrain their effectiveness."]

A qualitative comparative approach will be used to capture these subtleties, enabling a precise and contextualized examination of the major determinants of governance. By considering the institutional and sociopolitical factors that influence the use of digital tools, this method makes it possible to identify significant trends and distinctions between the two regions.",
          "This study will examine the underlying reasons of corruption and assess the efficacy of countermeasures by utilizing a variety of qualitative data sources, such as published research findings and expert consensus. These revelations are essential to comprehending the formation of public trust in governance structures. According to this theory, political outcomes are the results of government initiatives to resolve conflicts between conflicting interests while guaranteeing the equitable and effective allocation of resources. Since economic inequality and inequities have a big impact on how the public views legitimacy and efficacy, special attention is paid to how these issues are handled. The study intends to demonstrate the connection between enhanced governance performance and anti-corruption initiatives by analyzing these dynamics.",
          "The government will be better equipped to handle civil unrest, resource shortages, and environmental issues as well as make strategic investments in important institutions like education if it can remain consistent and deliver its services in an organized manner. The foundation for more extensive change, such as the transition to a digital state, is laid by effective governance in these domains. The government can improve accountability and openness by adopting new technologies. This advancement promotes long-term development objectives while also bolstering institutional trust. In the end, a responsive and well-coordinated government is better equipped to address the demands of the populace and promote sustainable progress in a world that is becoming more digitally connected.",
          "Continuously, information obtained will explain challenges faced by integration, such as justice isolation, social engagement, and disintegration that reveal the people's trust and attitudes towards their governments. A historical overview will be particularly included to highlight unique challenges and conflicts that arose from the cultural and social status quo. Hence, findings will give insight into possible methods that India can adapt , such as strong institutional frameworks, according to their governing style, that ensure proper regulations. This includes the values of accountability and delivering operational continuity actions as well as the consequences of such changes.",
          "Moreover, it is important to emphasize that this research does not romanticize the digitalization of cities and their institutions. While European cities have made significant strides in adopting digital technologies, they continue to confront complex and evolving challenges associated with these advancements. Recognizing both the opportunities and limitations of digital governance provides a balanced foundation for the analysis."

          "As urban governance becomes increasingly complex, governments are turning to digital tools to enhance transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement. This section explores in detail the key initiatives in India and select international cities that illustrate how digital systems are being deployed to strengthen public trust and improve administrative responsiveness.",
          "Indian Cases",
          "The Public Finance Management System was  launched in the late 2000s and has been of great use in tracking disbursements for social sector schemes all over India. It is connected to banks via a real‑time portal that enables monitoring of funds from the central government to beneficiaries at district and individual levels (PFMS, 2025). This system integrated pension and ration disbursements digitally as evident inAndhra Pradesh’s Krishna district hence a reduction in leakages(IMF, 2024).",
          "India’s centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) has captured eyes across the commonwealth for its impact(Business Standard, April 2024). The state‑level Integrated Grievance Redressal System resolved most of the complaints filed by care‑seekers with disabilities in Uttar Pradesh, demonstrating speed and transparency(Times of India, Jun 2025). ",
          "Integrated Command and Control Centres(ICCCs) run over 80 cities aggregating data from traffic, sanitation, CCTV, utilities, and public securities (Indian Express, 2022; Noida IAS Update, 2025). Pune and Bengaluru operate Smart City Command Centres with numerous sensors, emergency call boxes, dashboards, and real‑time analytics (LinkedIn/Pune; PC Mohan/Bengaluru). During the COVID‑19 pandemic, 45 such centres were rapidly repurposed into war‑rooms for tracking, helpline coordination, and logistics support (PMC NCBI, 2022; Economic Times, 2020). Several cities have integrated ICCCs into municipal budgets or adopted self‑sustaining models despite the end of central funding in March 2025(Hindustan Times, May 2025).",
          "The Swachhata App, launched under the Swachh Bharat Mission by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), enables citizens to register sanitation-related grievances via a geo-tagged, time-stamped mobile interface. Citizens can track the status of their complaints, view before-and-after resolution images, and interact with municipal officials, ensuring accountability and responsiveness (Janaagraha, 2024). As of 2024, over 27 million complaints have been registered with a reported resolution rate of over 93% across 4,500+ cities (Janaagraha, 2024).",
          "The e-Municipality Project, part of the National e-Governance Plan, focuses on digitising core urban local body services such as property tax, water billing, trade licences, and grievance redressal. By allowing online service delivery, status tracking, and structured workflows, it reduces physical interaction, minimizes corruption, and improves service transparency (BANotes, 2024).",
          "The MyGov Portal, which was launched in July 2014 and is overseen by the National Informatics Centre, serves as a primary platform for citizen engagement and consultation. Research conducted by Banerjee (2021) characterizes MyGov as an example of open innovation—where ministries and citizens collaboratively develop policy inputs, thus enhancing the participatory and transparent nature of governance processes. Singh and Kaushik (2020) emphasize how MyGov has institutionalized direct contributions from citizens and centralized public discourse among governmental departments. Nevertheless, empirical evaluations (The Hindu Centre, 2021) reveal a limited engagement in essential policy drafts: only approximately 8% of the discussions hosted were related to pre-legislative drafts, and only 11 out of 60 ministries were involved, indicating a tendency towards selective transparency (The Hindu Centre, 2021).",
          "European Cases",
          "The City of Amsterdam is leading the digital initiatives in Europe by incorporating ICT into, not only the government, but also towards the civil sector (Digital Cities: Amsterdam’s Ecosystem of Cooperation, n.d.; Netherlands - Digital Economy, 2024). This reflects the continuous progress of successfully strengthening the State-Citizen relationship as it incorporates research institutions as well, and collectively addresses various issues. It has been stated that Amsterdam collaborated with multinational ICT companies resolving conflicts and secrecy to cooperation and transparency which too revealed accountability (Digital Cities: Amsterdam’s Ecosystem of Cooperation, n.d.). According to the city’s second Digital Agenda 2023/2026, the core principles of believing in “A Digital City that is human, reliable and future proof”. Furthermore, another ongoing initiative that is recognised as Amsterdam InChange, used to be known as Amsterdam Smart City that was birthed in 2017 (ITA, 2025), prioritises the residences' and users’ of these cities interests and engagement through the tools, data and technology (ASC, 2025). As indicated in the methodology, the government’s ability to sustain consistency with thorough organisation, will have a greater chance to transform into a digital state and secure transparency through technological advancements. Consequently, this initiative has created a trust mechanism resulting in a cohesive environment in which citizens’ participation is the foundation platform where exchanging valuable and knowledgeable information with one another, to improve the city, takes place.",
          "Similarly in Finland’s Helsinki, reputable for the self-organised communities, integrates ICTs to generate quality rich “community activities and environment” (Horelli, Saad-Sulonen, Wallin and Botero, 2013) through various initiatives. Thus, Finland’s e-planning has intersected “urban planning and community development” (Horelli, Saad-Sulonen, Wallin and Botero, 2013) through the Learning-based framework, which enhance further the participation and flow of the state-citizen relationship regarding the daily life within the city. Continuously, Finland has invested the most in quantum computing research in comparison to other European countries to sustain the pace of technological developments around the world and within its country (ITA, 2025).",
          "Estonia's capital city of Tallinn is regarded as one of the world's best examples of digital administration. Tallinn has improved accountability and openness by implementing digital technologies at every level of urban service delivery as part of the e-Estonia initiative. X-Road, a secure data exchange network that links more than 900 public and commercial bodies and allows for real-time information sharing while protecting data privacy, is an essential part of this infrastructure (e-Estonia Briefing Centre, 2023). This innovation lowers the possibility of corruption and minimizes bureaucracy. Furthermore, blockchain technology has been integrated into public procurement procedures, allowing contracts and financial records to be securely stored with time stamps. This improves auditability for oversight and civil society organizations (Tatar & Kalvet, 2021). Despite being a national program, e-Residency has a big urban influence on Tallinn since it makes it possible for non-residents to communicate with local authorities, create enterprises, and obtain legal services—all of which promote transnational transparency (Digital Nations Report, 2024). In keeping with EU digital goals, the city also runs a comprehensive Open Data Portal that provides access to municipal data on zoning, transportation, and budgets. This makes it possible for people, NGOs, and journalists to hold local government officials responsible (City of Tallinn, 2024). In accordance with EU anti-corruption and inclusion directives, Tallinn stresses digital inclusion by providing ICT training for elderly persons and rural immigrants, even in the face of widespread e-service penetration (Estonia Digital Strategy, 2023). These initiatives offer as an example of a governance approach in which technology enhances democratic engagement by enabling citizens to actively observe the government rather than being passively watched. Tallinn thus exemplifies how smart urban systems can foster both efficiency and civic empowerment."

        heading: "Interpretation and Analysis",
        paragraphs: [
          "The digital governance initiatives in India and Europe, while sharing a lexicon of transparency and participation, are fundamentally expressions of two different state-citizen relationships, shaped by divergent historical contexts and contemporary challenges. A comparative analysis reveals that these are not merely different tools for similar problems, but different solutions for entirely different problems altogether. Where Indian digital governance is a story of a post-colonial state using technology to establish order and transactional trust across a vast, developing nation, the European model is one of mature democracies leveraging technology to deepen an existing, though sometimes strained, social contract.",
          "This core difference is most evident in the foundational purpose of their flagship initiatives. India’s Public Finance Management System was born of necessity—a direct, top-down assault on the systemic corruption and financial leakages that have plagued its welfare state. It is a tool of control, designed to impose accountability where it was historically absent. In stark contrast, Amsterdam’s Right to Challenge initiative emerges not from a crisis of corruption, but from a crisis of alienation, addressing a perceived gap between a functioning state and the needs of its citizens. The Indian system thus uses technology to build trust from a low baseline by proving its ability to deliver services honestly, while the Dutch system uses technology to sustain trust by devolving power and agency to a citizenry that already expects to be heard. One is an instrument of administrative necessity; the other is an evolution of democratic principle.",
          "This distinction permeates the nature of citizen participation. Where India’s Swachhata App provides a structured, top-down channel for citizens to report sanitation failures to a central authority, Helsinki's open budgeting platforms or Amsterdam's co-creation projects invite citizens to define the problem and allocate resources themselves. The Indian citizen is positioned as a monitor or a service recipient providing feedback to the state, a model evident even in the MyGov portal, where engagement often stops short of influencing core policy. Conversely, the European citizen is framed as a partner with the state. This reveals a different understanding of the citizen's role: in India, technology helps them hold a powerful state to account for its duties, whereas in Europe, it facilitates their active participation in the state’s decision-making processes, a reflection of a long-standing tradition of subsidiarity and local autonomy.",
          "The very architecture of digital systems reflects this philosophical divide. India's Integrated Command and Control Centres are centralized hubs of data aggregation and surveillance, designed to give the state a comprehensive view for managing urban chaos and ensuring security. They are instruments of management and control. This differs fundamentally from the logic of Tallinn’s X-Road infrastructure. While also a central system, X-Road is designed as a secure, decentralized enabler of interaction, not just for the state to see, but for all actors—citizens, ministries, and businesses—to exchange data transparently and securely. The ICCC is an architecture for top-down oversight, born from the need to manage complexity, while X-Road is an architecture for ecosystem-wide trust, born from a societal consensus on digital rights and transparency.",
          "Finally, this comparative lens reveals different approaches to the inherent risks of digitalization. In India, the 'transparency paradox' of providing information without ceding influence is a major challenge, and the deployment of advanced technology constantly battles the risk of deepening the digital divide. The solution to digital exclusion is often seen as a secondary challenge to the primary goal of technological implementation. This contrasts sharply with Tallinn’s proactive strategy of integrating ICT training for all demographic groups. For Estonia, digital inclusion is not an afterthought but a prerequisite for the legitimacy of its digital state. It represents a mature understanding that digital governance cannot succeed if it is not equitable, a principle that carries a far greater weight and complexity in India's vastly more diverse and unequal socio-economic landscape."

        paragraphs: [
          "We think that the following suggestions, which are based on a comparison of digital governance in India and Europe, provide a way for both parties to learn from one another and create urban governance models that are more open, inclusive, and successful.",
          "First and foremost, we believe that a more participatory model of digital governance should replace India's current top-down, control-oriented approach. Policymakers can create trust that goes beyond service delivery by adopting components of European frameworks, like Amsterdam's co-creation initiatives. As a result, the relationship between the state and its citizens shifts from one of administration to one of partnership, encouraging a greater feeling of citizen ownership and active participation in governance.",
          "However, if a digital governance system engages in social exclusion, it will not be effective. Thus, secondly, in order to bridge the gap between digitally advanced metropolitan centers and other areas, India must promote digital literacy, particularly in rural and vulnerable groups, if it hopes to make this new collaboration inclusive. One important lesson from Estonia's proactive inclusion strategy is that accessible tactics and customized training programs are essential to any deployment of digital governance, guaranteeing that no person is left behind.",
          "Thirdly, it is our deep conviction that India must abandon a paradigm in which power is still centralized and information is only accessible if it is to genuinely establish confidence through transparency. The creation of platforms that give people actual control over policy is the next stage. Passive information portals are unable to create the deep level of institutional confidence that may be fostered by allowing residents to directly engage in important procedures, such as municipal budgeting decisions, as demonstrated in Helsinki. Because of this, transparency is no longer a one-way message but rather an active, two-way roadway.",
          "The risks of data misuse and spying inevitably rise with the depth and decentralization of digitalization. Fourth, in order to protect its population, India must establish strong institutional and legal protections. Taking inspiration from Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and the ethical design principles incorporated into Tallinn's digital infrastructure, this entails creating comprehensive legal frameworks that explicitly enshrine digital rights, data privacy, and algorithmic accountability.",
          "Fifth, we insist that platforms like MyGov need to be updated. This will help make citizen feedback transparent and useful. People need to see that their opinions influence policy. Then trust in the system will grow. It is important that citizen participation is not limited to surveys. It is necessary to show how digital feedback is used in real decisions. This will help reduce the gap between consultation and action..",
          "Ultimately, it is important to develop a culture of digital citizenship. This is the foundation for sustainable change that goes beyond technology and politics. To create literate and engaged citizens, India must invest in education. This should focus on digital rights, responsibilities, and participation. Other steps are needed to reach people of all income and educational levels. We think that these could include countrywide awareness campaigns, best done in local languages and with the participation of the communities themselves. Such programs should clearly explain rights, such as freedom of speech and data protection. But it is also important to talk about responsibilities, such as the need to participate in online discussions."

    conclusion: [
      "As a result, this comparison of digital governance in Europe and India shows two different trajectories influenced by different historical and sociopolitical settings. Although both areas use technology to increase openness and public confidence, their primary driving forces are very different. Specifically, the majority of India's digital initiatives are a top-down reaction to structural issues like inefficiency in service delivery and corruption. They serve as instruments of control to impose responsibility. European models, on the other hand, like those in Tallinn and Amsterdam, come from a history of democratic cooperation. The goal of these programs is to increase public participation in the actual decision-making process. This is a significant distinction. One system distributes power to maintain confidence, while the other aims to establish trust by showcasing skill.",
      "We think that in order for India to advance, it needs to change its digital governance model from one that is control-oriented to one that is more participative. This calls for a multifaceted approach. In order to close the existing divide between urban elites and underprivileged communities, it is also imperative to invest in universal digital literacy. Furthermore, in order to safeguard data privacy and defend digital rights, strong legal frameworks that are modeled after laws like the GDPR must be developed.",
      "Thus, by embracing a more inclusive and decentralized approach, India can foster a culture of digital citizenship, transforming its governance landscape into a truly collaborative and transparent ecosystem."

    abstract: [
      "A vast majority of research on identity formation focuses on societal and environmental factors. However, there has been less research on the age factor in identity formation.There are various dimensions of the identity we form for ourselves ranging from achievement, moratorium, foreclosure, diffusion and achievement- moratorium cycle. This study uses quantitative data collected by a survey form based on the Modified Marcia Questionnaire to understand the formation of such identities in individuals of ages 18-24. The results of this study highlights the age factor in identity formation in young adults. A major chunk of the population of young adults have reached the dimension of achievement, and many are at the level of achievement moratorium cycle."

    intro: [
      "In today’s changing world, identity formation remains an important task for young adults as they gain more independence and face social pressures. They often start questioning their values, beliefs, goals, and the roles they play in different parts of life such as school, family, or work. Identity refers to an individual’s understanding of who they are, encompassing values, beliefs, goals, and roles in various domains of life. According to Erikson (1968), establishing a coherent identity is an important part of adolescence and young adulthood, where individuals resolve the tension between identity and role confusion to achieve psychological well being. He emphasised that this period is a period of confusion and experiments regarding identity and one’s life path. He talks of a psychological moratorium where teens put on hold to committing to an identity while they explore other options. ",
      "A more detailed framework for understanding identity development was offered by James Marcia (1966), who expanded on Erikson’s theory by introducing four identity statuses. Identity achievement describes individuals who have explored a range of options and made firm commitments to personal values, career paths, and beliefs, and is linked with higher self-esteem and clarity. Moratorium refers to those actively exploring identity alternatives without yet committing; this phase is often filled with uncertainty and psychological tension but is a critical stage in eventual identity resolution. In contrast, foreclosure involves strong commitments made without adequate exploration, often reflecting values inherited from authority figures or tradition, which may hinder future adaptability. Lastly, identity diffusion characterizes individuals who neither explore nor commit meaningfully, often resulting in fragmented or unstable self-concepts and increased emotional distress (Schwartz, 2001). These statuses illustrate that identity development is a dynamic and individual process, shaped by both internal drives and contextual influences. ",
      "Identity during young adulthood is shaped by a mix of personal and social influences such as family values, peer relationships, cultural background, education, and social expectations. Today, digital media adds a new aspect, offering spaces for self expression but also exposing young people to comparison, pressure, and confusion. At the same time, gender roles, financial realities, and access to education can either expand or restrict identity choices. Because of this, identity development isn’t just personal, it’s deeply shaped by context. Every young person’s journey is unique, unfolding at the intersection of self exploration and the world they live in.",
      "Studying identity formation in young adulthood matters because it shapes so much of a person’s future for example, how they feel about themselves, the choices they make, and how they relate to others. This stage of life, usually between 18 and 25, is a time of growing independence and big transitions. As young people move away from roles set by family or school, they begin to make more personal, self-directed choices (Arnett, 2000). They explore what they believe in, who they want to be with, and what kind of work they want to do. These explorations make identity development one of the most important psychological tasks. By understanding what supports or challenges identity development during these years, researchers and professionals can help young adults build a clearer, more meaningful sense of who they are, something that will guide them well beyond their twenties.",
      "The aim of this study is to analyse the identity formation of young adults in India and understand on what level they fall in Marcia's identity stages according to their age. "

        heading: "2.RATIONALE",
        paragraphs: [
          "Identity formation is one of the most significant psychological and social processes that individuals undergo during young adulthood. This phase of life, often marked by the transition from adolescence to early adulthood, is a critical period where individuals explore, question, and shape who they are in terms of values, beliefs, career goals, cultural background, gender roles, and personal identity",
          "In today’s world, young adults face a complex mix of influences—ranging from social media and peer pressure to educational expectations and shifting cultural norms. These influences can both support and challenge their process of self-discovery. With the rise of digital spaces and increased global connectivity, young people are exposed to diverse identities and ideologies, which often adds to their internal conflict or accelerates their personal growth.",
          "Our interest in this topic stems from the fact that identity formation is not just a personal journey—it is deeply social and cultural. Understanding how young adults form their identities can help educators, parents, mental health professionals, and policy-makers to better support them in making informed, healthy, and empowering choices.",
          "By focusing on this area, our research aims to explore the various dimensions focusing on how identity formation in young adults is influenced at this age such as family background, social context, peer relationships, digital influence, and cultural narratives—that shape identity development. We also aim to highlight the struggles young adults often face, such as identity confusion, pressure to conform, emotional uncertainty and also to understand how age and factors which an individual faces at this age influences identity formation.",
          "Ultimately, this study hopes to contribute to a better understanding of how identity is formed, negotiated, and expressed among young adults today—and why this process is so vital for their overall well-being and future growth."

The results showed that men had higher scores in commitment, while women scored higher in exploration and ruminative thinking. Identity commitment had a stronger positive effect on well-being for men than for women.",

The researchers thought that broader exploration would reduce symptoms, while deeper, ruminative exploration could raise them. The results revealed that broader exploration was connected to fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast, deeper exploration predicted higher levels of anxiety and depression, partly influenced by perceived support from close relationships.",

          "This study examines how identity development processes-specifically exploration and commitment-are associated with psychological well-being in young adults. The researchers hypothesized that higher levels of identity commitment, combined with active exploration, would predict greater life satisfaction and lower depressive symptoms. Conducted on 425 university students aged 18-25, participants completed measures of identity styles, commitment, exploration, and psychological adjustment. Regression analyses revealed that identity commitment was a significant predictor of well-being, while ruminative exploration correlated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. The study emphasizes the dual role of exploration-adaptive when future-oriented but maladaptive when excessive or obsessive. This research is crucial to understanding identity formation, as it highlights how balancing commitment with thoughtful exploration enhances psychological well-being in young adults.",

Based on qualitative interviews and surveys with individuals aged 18-25 across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, the study proposes that emerging adulthood is a time for experimenting with various life possibilities, including work, love, and worldviews. Arnett argues that identity formation in this period is prolonged due to societal changes like delayed marriage and extended education. This theoretical framework is foundational for research on young adults' identity development, as it contextualizes the psychosocial dynamics of identity exploration in modern societies, providing a comprehensive lens through which the variability in identity trajectories can be understood.",

          "This study investigates how online self-presentation affects identity processes among adolescents and emerging adults. The study hypothesized that greater authenticity in online profiles would correlate with stronger identity clarity and self-esteem. A sample of 216 college students (ages 18-22) completed surveys on their social media use, identity clarity, and self-perception. Results indicated that individuals who curated authentic self-presentations online reported higher identity clarity and lower levels of self-concept confusion. Conversely, those who engaged in exaggerated or idealized portrayals exhibited more identity-related distress. This research is particularly relevant in the digital age, illustrating how virtual platforms serve as spaces for identity exploration and experimentation, significantly impacting the development of coherent and stable identities among young adults. ",
          "3.8 Parental and Peer Influences on Identity Formation in Emerging Adulthood by Crocetti, E., Rubini, M., & Meeus, W. (2008)",
          "This study explores the impact of parental and peer relationships on the identity formation process. The study hypothesized that supportive parenting and quality peer relationships would facilitate identity commitment and reduce identity confusion. A longitudinal sample of 357 adolescents transitioning into emerging adulthood (ages 17-21) was assessed using identity status interviews and relationship quality scales. Findings revealed that parental support predicted greater identity commitment over time, while peer relationship quality was linked to ongoing identity exploration and reconsideration. The study underscores the critical role of relational contexts in shaping identity trajectories, emphasizing that identity formation is not an isolated process but deeply embedded in social interactions. These findings are essential to understanding how familial and peer influences contribute to identity coherence in young adults."

          "This report analyses the distribution of identity status across young adults based on James Marcia's Identity Status Theory. According to the theory, everyone goes through stages of crisis and commitment in their life that define their identity over time. To Indianize the same, we took data from 57 young adults between the age of 18-25 in order to know how the identity development progresses for the same theory in an India context. The five identity statuses considered are: ",

          "5.  MAMA: Moratorium-Achievement cycle",
          "Basically we found that even in an Indian context Identity is not very significantly formed by age or factors that come with age or time. Although the data shows there is a positive relationship between age and identity status and clarity being high by a low significance, it is true that age does affect identity formation alongside one’s experiences and commitment. The pie chart below shows how 78.3% of the young adults have achieved the last stage of identity formation while, 8.7% are in a stage of Identity Moratorium, 2.2% are in Identity Foreclosure and 6.5% are still in identity diffusion stage. The remaining 4.3% are still undergoing changes with their identity and going through the cycle of Moratorium and Achievement in varying contexts over time.",

          "The correlation  test result was not statistically significant (p = 0.992), indicating that there is minorly strong evidence to suggest a relationship between age and identity status in this dataset. But that is because the data collected was in a limited sample with outliers that weren’t accounted for.",
          "The p value is greater than 0 showing a positive relationship between age and identity, even though it's less than 1 or minorly significant, with profound research it might prove to be right for a major population too.",
          "1. “My parents decided a long time ago what I should go into for employment and I'm following through on their plans.” – This indicates Identity Foreclosure: commitment without exploration. Individuals accept others' values and expectations without questioning them.",
          "●	Why it's scored low: While Indian families traditionally influence career decisions heavily, this response scoring lowest may reflect a generational shift. Many young adults are becoming aware that parentally imposed decisions often create dissatisfaction, and they are trying to resist blindly following them. This low score likely reflects growing conflict between traditional family expectations and modern individual aspirations, leaving individuals caught in identity confusion or moratorium.",
          "2. “I don’t have any close friends. I just like to hang around with the crowd.” – Reflects Identity Diffusion :lack of commitment and exploration in social relationships.",
          "●	Why it's scored low: Low scores on this suggest that Indian youth, even when feeling socially uncertain, do desire authentic, intimate friendships. Culturally, friendships are valued and collectivist society places a premium on meaningful group belonging. The low score reflects a discomfort with superficial social bonds and a preference for deeper relational identity development, even if those are lacking.",

          "●	Why it’s scored low: In a competitive and education-focused Indian society, employment is closely tied to identity and family honor. Even if individuals are unsure, apathy toward career choices is socially frowned upon. The low score indicates that most respondents feel pressure to be career-focused, even if unsure of what they want. This shows external pressure may force individuals into a pseudo-identity, suppressing diffusion.",

          "●	Why it's scored low: Similar to Question 1, the low score reflects growing dissatisfaction with pre-decided career paths. Many Indian youth explore different career options (moratorium) but feel they lack agency to choose due to parental influence. The internal dissonance reflects a crisis stage in identity development.",
          "5. “I’m trying out different types of dating relationships, I just haven’t decided what is best for me.” – Identity Moratorium.",
          "●	Why it’s scored low: Indian society remains conservative about dating, especially outside urban or liberal circles. The low score may reflect limited opportunity or societal judgment in exploring romantic relationships freely. Youth may feel guilt, secrecy, or repression while navigating romantic identity, indicating a suppression of moratorium or exploration in the intimacy domain.",
          "6. “I don’t have any real close friends, and I don’t think I’m looking for one right now.” –Identity Diffusion",
          "●	Why it's scored low: Indian collectivist values emphasize community, family, and long-term friendships. Even when friendships are weak, the ideal is to form them. This low score may suggest a discomfort with isolation and that emotional closeness is still deeply desired. People may feel disconnected, but they don’t see it as acceptable or fulfilling, reflecting a struggle rather than acceptance of diffusion.",
          "7. “I only go out with the type of people my parents expect me to date.” –Identity Foreclosure",
          "●	Why it's scored low: In Indian culture, romantic and marital relationships are highly family-controlled, especially regarding caste, religion, or social background. A low score may indicate inner resistance to these norms. While youth often comply externally, internally they may not identify with those choices. The low score reflects increasing personal agency and desire for romantic autonomy.",

          "●	Why it's scored low: Similar to Question 3, individuals feel pressured to choose a stable or high-status job, and “drifting” is seen as failure in Indian society. Even if someone is unsure, they are likely to present a front of career intentionality. This low score suggests that respondents are uncomfortable with uncertainty and may avoid acknowledging diffusion due to societal expectations.",

At this point, people exhibit minimal amounts of both exploration (experimenting with various ideas or roles) and commitment (deciding on values, goals, or identity). They often float through life without a clear aim or defined purpose, frequently feeling detached from others and unsure of their true identity.",
          "●	In contrast to those who engage in exploration or commitment, individuals in diffusion might steer clear of contemplating their future; this absence of an identity framework may result in sensations of aimlessness, disconnection, or emotional dullness.",
          "●	Among Indian youth between 18 and 24 years old, identity diffusion can manifest as confusion regarding career choices, personal convictions, or values, particularly when young individuals have limited opportunities or support to explore their inclinations. As diffusion typically emerges in early adolescence and diminishes with age, it is less prevalent by early adulthood; however, if it continues, it could indicate that the individual has not yet undertaken meaningful self-exploration or established any significant commitments. Individuals trapped in diffusion frequently express feelings of low self-worth, diminished motivation, and limited involvement in personal or social objectives. ",

Hence the sampling could have been more varied and included an equal number of participants from all age groups. Also because the sampling method was random some of the participants did not fill out the questionnaire truthfully and tried to fill the form without interest leading to redundant answers or same choices for all questions which later had to be removed from the data analysis. A regulated and non biased sample should have been selected but the lack of time and the willingness of individuals influenced the sample. Finally, working with a larger sample size would have given us more accurate results which was one of our biggest limitations.",
          "2.Socio-Cultural Constraints on Identity Exploration  questionnaire",
          "Within the Indian collectivist framework, choices regarding careers, beliefs, and relationships are largely influenced by family, caste, or community standards. Young adults frequently encounter restricted educational and employment opportunities, along with limited freedom to pursue ideological or relationship decisions, particularly if these differ from societal norms. This structural constraint complicates the transition for many from the moratorium stage to achievement, or may lead them to move too hastily towards foreclosure, where an identity is accepted without adequate exploration.",
          "3.Peer, Social Media & Self-Presentation Biases while answering ",
          "Today's youth are subjected to an unprecedented level of comparison and pressure to present themselves positively through social media. These platforms heighten social comparison—resulting in insecurity or a fragmented sense of self—and magnify peer norms across social class, gender, or beliefs that may clash with their genuine values. Consequently, many individuals find themselves in an extended moratorium phase, reassessing their identity in light of fluctuating social benchmarks.",
          "4.Intersectional Challenges: Caste, Class, Gender, and Geography  were not accounted for in the questionnaire",
          "Elements such as caste, socio-economic status, gender identity, and the divide between rural and urban areas significantly influence the trajectory of identity development. Youth from lower-caste backgrounds or those facing economic hardships often encounter discrimination and limited opportunities, while societal gender norms restrict the freedom to explore unconventional roles, particularly for women seeking relationships or careers that challenge traditional expectations. Consequently, intersectional marginalisation can hinder or complicate the transition from exploration to achievement."

    conclusion: [
      "Identity formation is influenced by various factors but the formation of an identity for an individual has multiple dimensions.Through this research, we were able to understand that the young adults have majorly completed this task of establishing an identity according to their age. Even though the correlation established between age and Identity Achievement was not very significant, the P value showed a positive co-relation of 0.992.",
      "Understanding the complexities of identity formation and its variation among young adults is very essential for developing effective strategies to support their academic and personal growth,and helping their transition from adolescence to adulthood. This study reveals that identity development is shaped by a mix or combination of individual experiences, socio-cultural influences, family expectations and values rather than by age alone. Recognising diverse pathways and challenges faced by young adults including the intersectional impacts of caste,gender,class and environment highlights the critical need for tailored approaches.",
      "By addressing all those unique challenges and strengthening support and providing a supportive environment whether in educational institutions,communities or families stakeholders can nurture a healthy identity exploration and foster a sense of autonomy and commitment among young adults.",
      "Ultimately, embracing an holistic, flexible and inclusive framework for Identity development empowers young adults to navigate their transition into adulthood from adolescence and thrive to fulfill the demands of a challenging society, build resilient self-concepts and achieve their true potential. Policymakers and institutions must commit to ongoing research and adaptation to ensure that all young people are given a chance or facilitated to shape their identities and future.",
      "The study brings the scope of further research with a larger sample and Indianised version of the questionnaire. We observed that in the Indian context, family norms and cultural beliefs play a very significant role in a person finding and associating themselves to a particular identity. ",
      "We can conclude that with relation to various factors such as peer pressure, conformity, and cultural beliefs, Age drives the formation of one’s Identity."

    abstract: [
      "This paper addresses the complicated contortions of the United States in the Middle East, where strategic hegemony is interpreted through a mostly humanitarian lens. Beyond the blatant interventions of Iraq and Syria, the paper examines less discernable U.S. interventions in Yemen, Lebanon, and Oman—geographies that have taken up U.S. influence and control by making use of aid, diplomacy, and military partnerships without open hostilities. This paper uses Realist approaches to theories and critical discourse analysis and shows how doctrines such as the “Responsibility to Protect” are instrumentalized and strategically deployed to advance its strategic interests. The paper then turns to the U.S.-Israel relationship and examines how the convergence of Commonwealth, political, social, and religious affinities influences policy decisions. At the same time, American complacency in Palestine and recent involvement in military strategies against Iran certainly raises legitimate doubts about the U.S. credibility as a peacebuilder. In conclusion, the research argues that humanitarianism is an engineered instrument of American hegemony, wherein the concept of intervention shifts from the making of overt war to subtle domination."

      "Power no longer shows up in tanks. Power shows up in language, in leverage, in legal cover. It offers peace, but leaves ash. A  Diplomacy in which the language of liberation is often just a mask for imperial ambition. This research proceeds from that tension the paradox of American presence in the Middle East. The United States’ involvement in the Middle East is often explored through its most overt violence invasions of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. But the true shift in power occurs in other areas in places where the U.S. employs not invasion, but invisibility. These are quiet laboratories in which the differences between humanitarianism and hegemony have become indistinguishable. In places like Yemen, Lebanon, and Oman, the American presence is being discussed more often than the U.S. military presence, but the implications are even more pronounced. These are not traditional or classic battlegrounds but They are silent laboratories, where the line between aid and influence, protection and regulations, has eroded beyond recognition.",
      "Background –",
      "In which case it refuses the binary of invader/saviour and rather maps out the architecture of a power that has mastered how to adapt: from overt military domination to embedded political and economic presence, disguised as humanitarian initiatives. Conventional academic approaches have focused on the exposed conflicts and interventions; that of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria more noticeably, while the United States remains to be understood on how they orient an enduring, strategic presence through sustained, systemic, and muted practices.",
      "By the late 2000s and early 2010s particularly following the Arab Spring uprisings. The United States began strategically revaluating its battle against radicalization in the Middle East. It pivoted away from direct combat role and toward a vision in which it exerted influence regularly but sustainably and with less political capital. This pivot stands out in a number of contexts particularly the following three. ",
      "1.First, in Yemen (after 2014) the United States adopted an indirect approach to combat radicalization and provided direct support to the Saudi-led coalition while justifying its participation by focusing on humanitarian initiatives.",
      "2.Second, in Lebanon (after the 2006 war) the United States made substantial efforts to develop national institutions to represent an alternative stabilizing force to Hezbollah, especially its support for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).",
      "3.Third, in Oman, throughout the 2010s, the United States developed quiet military partnerships and took advantage of Omani policy neutrality to facilitate diplomatic back channelling.",
      "The U.S. is deeply involved in several places, such as Yemen, Lebanon, and Oman, where we are supplying arms while financing humanitarian aid in Yemen, we condition the political outcome in Lebanon with assistance, and we unobtrusively operate military capabilities in Oman. There are institutional mechanisms inherent across the DoD, DoS, USAID and international organizations that enable the U.S. to provide influence without intervention. This paper examines this model where humanitarianism is often a front for calibrated hegemony."

          "The United States’ current foreign policy is indicative of a more pronounced transformation from visible military power to a more implicit control via humanitarian rhetoric, multilateral agency resourcing, and peace diplomacy. The shift that is referred to in this dissertation as ‘strategic humanitarian governance’ allows the U.S. to project influence across regions without the requirement of a traditional military. Recent diplomatic efforts by the U.S. including proposals for the disarmament of Hezbollah (ABC News, 2025, highlight how we disguise geopolitical plans in peacebuilding talk and raise serious considerations regarding the use of humanitarian governance to alter regional balance of power. In states such as Yemen, Lebanon, and Oman, a stark duality can be seen. In Yemen, U.S. humanitarian assistance for Yemenis exists alongside a licensed arms sale for the Saudi-led coalition’s activities against the Houthis. In Lebanon, providing assistance for the Lebanese Armed Forces is framed as peacekeeping but is used as a tool to contain Shia political power, at present with Hezbollah. In Oman, constructing an identity of neutrality provides cover to coordinate military and intelligence assessments of the region.",

This fusion of strategic ambition and moral rhetoric has sparked ongoing debates in both academic and policy-making circles. It raises fundamental issues regarding the intersection of power, intervention, global stability, and ethical justification.",
          "From the perspective of realist theory particularly hegemonic stability theory as outlined by Robert Violin 1981 a single dominant power is necessary to maintain international order. Following the cold war, the US emerged as the leading global Hegemon and sought to shape the Middle East geopolitical environment through a combination of military strength, economic leverage, and diplomatic leadership (Walth,2005). However this leadership is driven less by altruistic motives and more by the strategic imperative to maintain a favorable balance of power.",

The United States has always supported authoritarian regimes like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Gulf States and Jordan, not out of democratic solidarity but for geopolitical reasons (Kirkpatrick, 1979). The United States pursued a containment theory in this region during the Cold War period with countries such as Saudi Arab, Iran, Israel. After the disintegration of the USSR, the United States adopted a more direct hegemonic role, which became an evidence of long term military presence in Iraq, in 1991 Gulf War and the Persian Gulf ( Gause, 2009). In 2002 Bush gave the concept of National Security Strategy and introduced the doctrine of Preemptive war under this in 2003 Iraq invasion was justified. Scholars such as Khalidi 2013 and Parsi 2007 argue this enhanced U.S. dominance at the cost of regional peace and sovereignty.",

          "In disclosing the facade of humanitarianism as covert statecraft, U.S. foreign policy must undergo the cleansing of ethics and structural decoupling. First, there would be the institutionalization of a Geo-Humanitarian Firewall Protocol, i.e., a protocol requiring that military logistics cannot be linked in any verifiable manner to humanitarian assistance, with transregional ethics council-based enforcement. Second, creating Assembly for Recipient-Led Resilience (ARRs) would ensure that non-negotiables for aid conditionality are set by frontline states such as Yemen, Lebanon, and Oman in order to prevent support from being legitimate for political containment. Third, a Diplomatic Influence Disclosure Act should be passed in order to make public all bilateral humanitarian negotiations and detail where aid serves ideological ends. Furthermore, the Digital Hegemony Tracker would monitor the simultaneous convergence of defense cooperation with development diplomacy in real-time. Finally, Ethical Imbalance Simulations could be embedded within American foreign policy academia to help train diplomats in evaluating the long-term fallout of double-edged aid. Using simulation case labs based on past neglect, such as Lebanon post-2006, will potentially build anticipatory ethics."

      "These proposals challenge From Hegemony to Humanitarianism? The Dual Role of the US in Middle East Peace and Conflict in International Relations Discourse, the topic suggests a broad approach towards peace resilience and engagement for prosperity with showing the dominance which was engaged since the beginning of geopolitical change. US engagement in Middle East is not a new phenomenon it existed since a long while where tensions between hegemonic approach and humanitarian intervention existed in parallel forms, the duality shown in Yemen by supporting Saudi led government to supplying military assistance to Israel simultaneously providing humanitarian aid to Gaza all this is nothing but a strategic interest where power is driven through persistent frame of democracy combined with American foreign policy, where efforts toward peace are frequently undermined by alliances with authoritarian regimes, military interventions, and selective support for human rights. Within international relations discourse, this duality challenges scholars and practitioners to critically reassess the authenticity of humanitarian justifications and the long-term implications of hegemonic behavior disguised as benevolent leadership. Moving forward, a more coherent and ethically consistent U.S. approach will be essential for achieving genuine stability and credibility in the region.",
      "The United States’ strategic hegemony and humanitarian rhetoric are purposefully combined in the Middle East. Through the use of aid, diplomacy, and institutional support in place of overt warfare, the United States transforms intervention into a more palatable but no less effective form of control. It has demonstrated by its activities in Yemen, Lebanon, and Oman how soft power tools can uphold geopolitical goals while putting on a moral front. According to this study, maintaining domination is more important than providing aid in “strategic humanitarian government.” In light of the ongoing debate over the morality of intervention, the U.S. model calls into question the traditional divisions between power projection and peacebuilding and calls for a reassessment of the viability and significance of such a dual-purpose foreign policy.

    abstract: [
      "This study looks at India's growing fiscal risks, especially those that its states must deal with. The study contrasts the more stable fiscal practices of Maharashtra with the financial vulnerabilities of states like Punjab, Rajasthan, and Kerala using trend analysis, VECM modeling, and case studies. The authors contend that pre-election welfare spending, off-budget expenses, and high debt levels are putting pressure on subnational finances. In order to maintain fiscal stability, the paper highlights flaws in existing frameworks, such as the FRBM Act, and promotes long-term, reform-based fixes. ",
      "In order to address fiscal vulnerabilities across the states, the recommended policy implications center on the necessity of a sustainable revenue base, disciplined expenditure, and institutional accountability. The analysis of the VECM model supports long-term relationships between macro-fiscal variables and shows that the fiscal deficit itself is not significantly responsive. This implies that relying only on automatic adjustments is not as important as proactive, institutional reforms. The forecasting section projects that revenue expenditures, interest payments, and the fiscal deficit will all moderately stabilize over the next five years.",

      "In spite of efforts to exercise fiscal prudence, India's outstanding debt of around 80% of GDP remains the key constraint. Further stresses are induced by off-budget borrowing, rapidly increasing welfare costs, and policy shocks generated, most likely, by weather-related events as well as subsidy waivers that are disturbing the subnational economic landscape.",
      "1.2	Brief Background",
      "Since the 1991 liberalization reforms and the setting up of the FRBM Act in 2003, the successive governments have been required to meet deficit and debt targets. However, the framework has been put under considerable strain, such as from the cessation of GST reimbursements, the pandemic, and rising populist expenditure. State borrowing now accounts for nearly 40%, with contingent liabilities growing, frequently concealed through guarantees to power distribution companies, pension obligations, and welfare benefits. Punjab is structurally imbalanced, while Rajasthan's pension reform rollback and Kerala and West Bengal's off-budget spending are all indicators of increased fiscal strength in the states.",

In response, then Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh presented a historical union budget where extensive reforms—trade, reduced grants, attracting foreign investments, and restructuring of industrial policy—were introduced.",
          "The purpose of these reforms was to build a stable macroeconomic basis not just for improvement, which highlights the need for long-term tax judgment. This vision was legally expressed physically through the law on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM), 2003. The purpose was to reduce the fiscal deficit by 3% of GDP and bring more openness and prognosis for public finance. However, FRBM lacked strict enforcement. Although the introduced multi-year plan and compulsory reporting, Escape Clause governments were allowed to distract from goals without meeting automatic punishment, especially during crises.",
          "As a complement to key reforms, the twelfth Finance Commission (2005) encouraged the states to adopt their own fiscal responsibility (FRLS), which gave them debt relief. In the mid-2000s, most states had implemented FRLS and set deficit goals for their specific fiscal needs. However, through PSU and SPV, the emergence of lending and state guarantees began to destroy openness with a view to establishing these laws.",

Singh suggested significant updates—for example, a joint state loan of 60%, more practical deficit goals, and the construction of an independent fiscal council to monitor compliance.

The choice of fiscal expansion before the election, even though it is politically motivated, has emphasized the state's finances without this increase in tax revenues. For example, Punjab's subsidy alone took around 24% of total expenditure, limiting the fiscal site for capital investments and infrastructure.",
          "Such unbalanced expenditure patterns have weakened the compliance with the FRBM structure and have created structural pressure on the state budget. To ignore the statutory loan boundaries, many states used victims through the public sector (PSU) and special objective vehicles (SPVs), with hidden random obligations of 3-4% of GSDP in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Punjab, with a lot of RBI. These obligations, although the state budget has not been completely revealed, are supported by governments and constitute systemic fiscal risks.",

The state saw a significant fiscal deficit of 12.3% in 2016-17, due in large part to hidden liabilities and over-borrowing, e.g., incurring debt on the gross domestic product basis. Punjab has been unable to escape from fiscal shortfalls above the 3% threshold since this maximum in-fiscal stress point, mainly due to inextricable losses incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the maximum recorded fiscal deficit was recorded at 5.4%.",
          "Tamil Nadu experienced some turbulence to its fiscal health but, unlike Punjab, maintained its fiscal deficit as a percentage of state GDP in a band from 2.4% to 2.9% from the period of 2013-19. Compared to its performance during 2017-19, Tamil Nadu experienced a higher trend increase during the COVID-19 pandemic for a maximum fiscal deficit of 5.5%. By 2021-22, Tamil Nadu brought down its fiscal deficit to just 4.8%, in good part due to a diversified economy, class-leading policy relating to borrowing, and actual economic industrial growth activity.",
          "Compared to both of these two index states, Maharashtra posted the greatest outcomes of sustainability, with a fiscal deficit at or below 2% for nearly the entire review period. Only during the COVID-19 pandemic did Maharashtra see a higher fiscal deficit at 3.3% and eventually back down to 2.2% by 2021-2022, with India broadly experiencing fiscal stress as a state economy. Maharashtra's semi-industrial-based state economy and robust expenditure management processes and frameworks also contribute to its overall fiscal health and the ability to manage overall risk."

    title: "Analysing the Scope of Feminist Foreign Policy in India: Challenges and Prospects",
    author: "Apratim Rashmi, Urukirti, Bhavyaa Sharma, Prarthana",
    authorAbbrev: "Deeksha; Saha, A.; Agrawal, P.; Dhar, N.; Vardani, A.",
    abstract: [
      "This paper investigates the ideological foundations and real-world applications of Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP), which is increasingly embraced as a multidimensional tool for promoting gender justice in global relations. Emerging as both a theoretical and policy-oriented framework, FFP challenges traditional notions of diplomacy that often prioritize military alliances and economic interests over human rights and inclusion. Guided by the “3Rs” model – Rights, Representation, and Resources (Swedish Government, 2018; Oxford Research Encyclopedia, 2019), laying a blueprint for integrating gender into diplomacy, defense, trade and development (Aggestam & True, 2020). The model emphasizes equitable participation of women and marginalized communities in foreign policymaking, thereby attempting to shift the focus from state-centric to people-centric governance. The study interrogates the extent to which this policy paradigm addresses root causes of inequality and violence, while also criticising its susceptibility to instrumentalization by states with conflicting domestic or geopolitical agendas (Thompson & Clement, 2019; SWP Berlin, 2021). While some governments have made substantial investments in multilateralism and inclusive diplomacy, the gap between normative ambition and material policy outcomes remains evident. In many cases, feminist rhetoric coexists with militarized borders or regressive social policies at home, raising questions about coherence and accountability. Recognizing the gap between ambition and delivery, it proposes that the next generation of feminist policy must adopt feminist-informed foresight, integrating long-term, participatory, and decolonial approaches (Jöster-Morisse, 2025). This anticipatory method allows for imagining alternative futures shaped by care ethics, intersectionality, and sustained peacebuilding. By focusing on inclusivity, transparency, and structural transformation, FFP has the potential to not only redefine diplomatic priorities but also foster more equitable global systems rooted in justice rather than power."

      "Feminist foreign policy refers to a political structure that prefers gender equality and women's rights in the creation and execution of a country's foreign relationships, diplomacy, trade, defense and development policy.",
      "This policy framework traces its origin way back in Sweden (2014) under Foreign Minister Margot Wallström (Margot Wallström, 2014) who pioneered the formal adoption of a policy based on Rights of women and girls, Representation in decision-making and Resources for gender equality.  It was inherent in liberal feminism, intersections and post -colonial feminist theory that criticizes male-oriented international relationships.",
      "Many countries have groundbreaking feminist foreign policy (FFP), which integrates equity into international relationships.  After Sweden, Canada on LGBTQ+ rights and inclusive development in 2017 with Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP). France adopted FFP in 2019, and focused gender equality in diplomacy with a Francophone focus. Mexico Use of FFP in 2020, highlighting multilateralism and gender budget, became the first global South Nation. In 2023, Germany launched its policy, in which women's roles were combined with climate diplomacy in peace and security. Each country brings different preferences of regional and political reference size. (Toni Haastrup & Laura Shepherd, 2022).",
      "However, India has not formally adopted a feminist foreign policy (FFP), but elements of gender inclusion exist within its international business. Gender is mainly evaluated in areas such as development aid, peace (Permanent Mission of India to the UN, 2007) and selective women's centric diplomacy. The initiative of India's soft diplomacy, such as International Solar Alliance and Yoga diplomacy, promotes inclusive leadership, but lacks a clear feminist structure."

          "The most important pillars of the feminist foreign policy (FFP) are usually about three main principles: rights, representation and resources. In 2014, introduced by Sweden, this '3R' structure emphasizes the protection of women's rights, ensures the allocation of resources to equal participation of women in decision -making processes and resources against equality. Many FFPs also include intersectionality, and admit how overlapping identity (e.g. race, class, sexuality) forms women's experiences. These columns are designed to address structural inequalities in the global rule, peace and development. (Toni Haastrup & Laura Shepherd, 2022).",

        paragraphs: [
          "The core for implementation of a feminist foreign policy in Indian requires structural and institutional changes. It entails analysing the current social and political milieu and providing recommendations for the Indian context. (Tapakshi Magan, 2022).",
          '1.     Limited Representation In Diplomacy And Policy Making: The women MPs constitute only 14% in the 18th Lok Sabha currently. (PRS Legislative Research, 2024). While women in Indian Foreign Service (IFS) comprise only 37.8% as of 2022, with minimal to no representation in top posts. (Kaul, 2023). This restricts the representation of affected women being part of decision-making and negotiation processes.',
          "2.     Patriarchal Institutional Cultures: The deep-rooted patriarchy hinders the inclusion of women in effective decision making. The success of FFP significantly depends upon the deconstruction of established dominant power structures, inclusion of marginalised communities and diversity of opinions. (Kiran, 2023).",
          "3.  Focus On Traditional Form Of Security: The policies and promises at national and international levels towards gender sensitivity remain superficial without any actual implementation because of a focus on national sovereignty and conventional forms of security. The proponents of this argument believe it is done to prevent international interference in the internal affairs of a country in order to protect women’s rights, as happened in Afghanistan. (Irene M. Santiago, 2023). ",
          "4.   Lack Of National Action Plan For India: India has not yet ratified UNSCR 1325 resolution, which is a significant step towards incorporating gender inclusivity concerns in peace and security governance. (Natasha, 2023). This resolution provides for mandatory implementation of National Action Plan. This plan shows a country's dedication to integrating gender into peace and security concerns. Likewise, despite having ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1993, India has yet to ratify the Optional Protocol, which permits individuals to directly contact the CEDAW committee in the event that the national systems do not adhere to the agreement's tenets. (Chopra, 2022). This means there is a lack of structured framework and clear strategy for implementation of Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda in India.  ",

        heading: "Approach to Conflict and Peace Building",
        paragraphs: [
          "Feminist foreign policy offers an innovative alternative to traditional ideas about conflict and peace. Rather than focusing solely on military power or state security, it emphasizes human security, aiming to ensure the safety of individuals—especially women—who are often most vulnerable due to systemic exposure to violence, poverty, and oppression. This approach defines peace not merely as the absence of war but as the presence of justice and equality in which human rights are fully upheld (Thompson, 2021).",
          "Inclusivity in Peace Processes",
          "Inclusivity is a key pillar of feminist foreign policy. According to this approach, sustainable peace cannot be achieved without the full and active participation of women at every stage of the peace process, including conflict resolution, negotiation, and post-war reconstruction. Research has shown that when women are involved in peacebuilding, the outcomes tend to be more stable and enduring (O'Reilly, O'Sullivan, & Puffenholz, 2015). Women often emphasise education, healthcare, and justice—critical components of long-term peace (Agstam & Tro, 2020). Their contributions help shape peace agreements that serve the broader needs of communities, rather than the interests of elite groups.",
          "Rejecting Violence in Diplomacy",
          "Another core element of feminist foreign policy is its rejection of violence as a tool of diplomacy. Instead of investing heavily in military defence, this policy promotes peaceful strategies such as dialogue, education, and international development. Sweden’s feminist foreign policy, for instance, focuses on reducing global inequality and advancing women’s rights through international cooperation and support (Swedish Government Offices, 2019). By addressing the structural roots of conflict, such as poverty and gender-based discrimination, this approach works to prevent violence before it erupts.",
          "A Broader Vision of Peace",
          "Ultimately, feminist foreign policy redefines peace not simply as the end of armed conflict, but as an active commitment to justice, equality, and the dignity of all people (Enloe, 2014). This reimagining of foreign policy reflects a more inclusive, equitable, and human-centred framework for achieving lasting peace."

          "Sweden",
          "Sweden pioneered Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) by being one of the first countries to take such initiative in 2014. The policy aims at systematic integration of gender perspective in their foreign policy agenda. (Nylund, Sandra & Elin, 2022). Further, the government also declared itself a feminist government in 2014. The Swedish foreign ministry embedded the FFP across all its departments, and established internal structures like gender focal points in each department to support the rollout of the FFP in a successful way. (Ekatherina, 2021). Sweden also propagated its feminist ideas through online platforms like Twitter and communications through its websites like #feminstforeignpolicy, which became a key hashtag. The strategic use of such digital diplomacy helped shape the domestic policy and create a global discourse on the underrepresentation of women’s biographies. (Annika Bergman & Elsa, 2022). This policy created an institutional shift in Sweden’s foreign policy. The increased participation in proliferation of peace and conflict prevention through the Security Council and promotion of gender equality across EU trade agreements were among the significant steps taken by the Swedish government in furtherance of this policy. (OECD, 2021). These steps resulted in an increase in the participation of women in dialogues and discourses on peace and security in the Security Council and European Council. (OECD, 2021). Swedish feminist policy is an important example of how government policy intervention can help in the promotion of feminist ideals in foreign policy and create a global impact. Although Sweden formally revoked its feminist foreign policy in 2022, it continues to uphold its commitments under the Women, Peace, and Security agenda. The adoption of the 2024–2028 National Action Plan reflects Sweden’s ongoing role as a signatory to UN Security Council Resolution 1325, signaling its sustained engagement in gender-responsive peacebuilding and diplomacy (PeaceWomen, 2025).",
          "Limitations of the Policy",
          "While the policy vision is to be transformative, the approach faces a range of practical, structural and conceptual limitations. It becomes difficult to define feminist foreign policy at a global level, which results in conceptual ambiguity and inconsistent application. Most countries widely adopt the '3 Rs' of the policy. ",
          "The discrepancy between rhetoric and practice is a major critique. Countries may employ feminist branding in their foreign policy while still supporting authoritarian governments, exporting weapons, or enforcing restrictive immigration laws that run counter to the fundamental tenets of FFP. Gender commitments are frequently superseded by state interests, placing feminist agendas beneath strategic, financial, or security objectives. As a result, foreign policy becomes business as usual, with gender equality taking a backseat. (Salazar, 2022)",
          "In an effort to address the underlying causes of violence and give priority to peacebuilding, feminist foreign policy frequently encourages demilitarisation and conflict prevention. They are constrained, nevertheless, in war scenarios where military action or strict security measures would be necessary. The realities of war, massacres, and hard power politics may be too much for the gender-sensitive viewpoint to handle, which begs the question of how well FFP holds up in practical situations and the necessity of crisis management. (Assad & Tausendfreund, 2022)",
          "Feminist foreign policy offers a valuable framework for advancing gender equality and upending conventional wisdom in international relations. Still, it has significant drawbacks in terms of definition, application, intersectionality, and opposition from dominant state interests and global politics. More clarity, sincere dedication, strong accountability, and an inclusive, intersectional strategy that closes the gap between ambition and reality are all necessary to address these constraints. "

    conclusion: [
      "Feminist foreign policy has revolutionised state approaches to diplomacy, development, security, and humanitarian aid by integrating a gender perspective. France's strategy (2025-2030) exemplifies this shift with concrete initiatives: defending sexual and reproductive rights, supporting feminist organisations, addressing gender-based violence, promoting girls' education, enhancing women’s economic independence, and fostering their participation in public decision-making. These priorities now influence diplomatic missions, foreign aid distribution, and humanitarian efforts. (France's International Strategy for Feminist Diplomacy (...), 2025)",
      "Future Feminist Foreign Policy Integration",
      "As explored in Clara Jöster-Morisse's paper on feminist-informed foresight, thinking about the future of FFP requires policy tools and an imaginative, anticipatory lens that challenges current paradigms. Feminist foresight involves integrating long-range thinking with feminist ethics—such as care, cooperation, and justice—into statecraft. This opens up space for re-imagining diplomatic priorities beyond crisis response and national interest, centring instead on the lived realities of marginalised communities around the globe. Jöster-Morisse argues that future FFPs must not just aim to mainstream gender but reframe the intent and operation of foreign policy itself. (Jöster-Morisse, 2025)",
      'At the same time, critiques of FFP, such as those presented in the International Studies Review article on governance feminism, urge a closer look at whether FFP risks becoming another form of soft power or symbolic governance. By embedding feminist language into state policy without challenging the inherent contradictions of military spending, border regimes, or selective humanitarianism, states may promote a superficial version of feminism. This perspective calls for a more radical and accountable version of FFP that champions rights abroad and interrogates colonial legacies and domestic inequalities within FFP-promoting states. (Bell & Wegner, 2025) Research from UN Women and the Heinrich Böll Foundation further adds a participatory and practitioner-oriented dimension. The importance of engaging feminist civil society actors, particularly from the Global South, is crucial to the legitimacy and sustainability of FFP. These organisations often bring grounded, context-specific knowledge that challenges top-down, donor-driven approaches to gender equality. Future policies must not only reflect feminist values in rhetoric but also allocate resources and institutional power toward grassroots leadership, inclusive policy design, and robust accountability mechanisms. (Janebová, 2025)',
      "By incorporating participatory processes, FFP has also driven institutional change within ministries and agencies. Civil society, including feminist groups, the private sector, research organisations, and international bodies, actively contributes to policy development and implementation. This inclusive approach ensures that underrepresented voices, particularly from the Global South and marginalised communities, shape policy discussions, focusing on intersectionality, the care economy, and anti-racism efforts.

    abstract: [
      "This article studies the localization of climate action through the lens of National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and its implementation through the framework of Panchayat Raj Institutions aiming to understand how effectively climate change is being localized in In the context of SDGs 13(Climate Action), we focus on assessing the alignment between national climate goals and their reach into community-level initiatives. The idea behind this study is to uncover the potential of decentralized governance in building climate-resilient Panchayats. Using the qualitative research methods such as policy reviews, literature reviews and case studies from selected Panchayats, by analyzing the current state of NAPCC mission integration at the local level. ",
      "It identifies three critical themes: (1) Climate Resilient Rural Development, (2) Policy and Institutional Synergies, and (3) Capacity Building and Finance. These themes guide the investigation into institutional, policy, and financial mechanisms that support or hinder effective climate action at the grassroots ",
      "This study reveals that many communities find it difficult to make the climate action plans implemented in their local level effectively. However, there are some notable cases—like the integration of GPDP, Mission LiFE, and collaborations with initiatives such as MGNREGA—that demonstrate how teamwork can drive real progress. The paper concludes with some practical recommendations: enhancing training for local leaders, ensuring better coordination among departments, and involving everyone in the planning process to make climate action more impactful at the local level.",

    intro: [
      "The national framework on climate change in India is based on the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) that outlines eight national missions aimed at promoting environmental sustainability and resilience to climate change. The NAPCC is strategic in its vision, but realizing that vision is contingent on its monocular application and incorporation into local actions. PRIs being the institutional levels responsible for rural development, are important agents of climate change governance. ",
      "Nonetheless, there are issues related to poor access to resources, inadequate institutional capacity, and limited policy coherence that challenge this localization. The introduction has the aim of laying the framework for understanding how the climate change agenda, as outlined at the level of the national agenda, is then translated into actions by the Panchayats.",

          "Rural India is on the frontline of climate change vulnerability. The majority of the rural population (more than 70%), for their livelihoods depend on agriculture and natural resources, are especially vulnerable with a degree of risk associated with more irregular weather events, insufficient water resources, land degradation and loss of biodiversity. Thus, climate resilient rural development represents more than a development challenge but also a question of climate justice, food security and sustainable national development over long timeframes.",
          "The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) provides a policy framework at the macro-level through 8 missions and their associated objectives, including the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), the National Water Mission (NWM) and the Green India Mission. At present, they are often not visible at the grassroots level and aligned to local institutions, and thus rarely act as vehicle for transformative change in rural society.",
          "Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) provide a particular institutional opportunity for decentralized and participatory climate action. They derive their legitimacy from the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, and are legislated to create and execute development plans for socio-economic development and social justice. If we embedded those objectives as part of the NAPCC in the Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) then community endorsed resilience strategies could facilitate local solutions to these vulnerabilities.",
          "The 'Climate Resilient Livelihoods' project in Malkangiri district, Odisha involved a collaborative partnership between Grams Panchayats, UNDP and the Odisha State Climate Change Cell. For PRIs, participatory vulnerability assessments in their communities helped to identify issues of concern, including cyclical floods and crop failures, and adaptive solutions, including elevated grain banks, saline first paddy varieties and decentralized solar irrigation. All of this was supported by relevant components of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and National Water Mission (NWM) which was an effective example of vertical integration connecting the policy with planning at the local sub-district level.",
          "Likewise, in Kolar, Karnataka, the Panchayat implemented water budgeting and demand-side groundwater management with guidance from the National Water Mission “Catch the Rain” campaign. This example shows how PRI-led microplanning can be cumulatively harnessed to meet mission targets on water efficiency.",

          "Weak convergence across sectors (agriculture, forestry, water, rural development).",
          "The next pivotal step is to create 'Climate-Resilient Panchayat Frameworks' at the state level, with allocated budgets, capacity development modules, and data dashboards around district-specific vulnerabilities.  The Climate Resilient Rural Development will also enhance the climate action or SDG 13 relationship as there is greater recognition of the importance of local action within the global space. The continued commitment of India to support climate-resilient communities through Mission LiFE and the Localizing SDGs Campaign can further bolster the ability of Gram Panchayats (GPs) to scale adaptation responses."

          "Successful climate governance in India relies on ongoing coordination between policy regimes and institutions. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), and their eight mission based approaches, creates strategic ideas on how to address climate challenges. The implementation part however, depends on how well it blends with State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) and becomes part of the local governance frameworks, especially through Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). This sensitive link, sometimes called policy and institutional synergy is essential to helping national goals falls into activities that have local relevance.",
          "One of the major challenge is the gap between center policy making and local implementation. While Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) give a mechanism for localizing climate priorities, poor coordination and inadequate technical assistance often limit their practical implementation. Many a times Panchayats are not fully utilized, despite the fact that Constitution have given role of panchayats separately for local development. Looking at the positive side, local developments have taken few steps, models such as watershed programs and behavior change initiatives merged with MGNREGA like programs exemplify the benefits of institutional synergy. These initiatives shows that if ministries, departments, and Panchayats work together closely, climate action can become more effective and inclusive.",
          "In order to augment this synergy, there is a need to institute formal coordination mechanisms at different levels. This must involve central ministries (such as MoEFCC and DST), state climate cells, and local government institutions. Providing access to climate information and financial resources, in particular through connecting funds from schemes such as PMKSY and Jal Jeevan Mission, is also essential. India is an agrarian country we know this agriculture happens in village, agriculture is the most crucial and ignorant in terms of taking it as a career. This is also due to no prominent outcome which ultimately linked to climate actions. Our actions, how we take care of the climate is given back to us, so it is utmost important to make local community familiar with climate actions and policies made for it causes.",
          "India has achieved its position in international climate discussions and debates, internal unity is important. Locals community should be aware of the policies made for them under climate action plans and implementation of those policies should be done effectively. Its of utmost importance to recognize panchayats, as actors and participants in the stakeholders participatory framework, rather than simply just implementers. At the end, the success of climate resilience at the grassroots level rests on enabling integrated policy interventions and institutional coordination to enable actor and beneficiary to enable to take ownership of their own adaptations initiatives.

PRIs manage over 250,000 Gram Panchayats that interact directly with almost 65% of the rural population in India (MoPR, 2020). Yet, with this powerful base, they are not able to achieve much with climate change, largely due to a shortage of technical knowledge and institutional assistance, as well as a lack of access to financial resources.",
          "Recent analysis finds, only 12% of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs), built climate resilience into their plans, and over 70% of Panchayats have never accessed climate specific funding (NIRDPR, 2021). Although GPDP or other funding mechanisms exist, such as the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), MGNREGA and PM-KUSUM, PRI participation is limited, due to their lack of understanding and skills to mobilize climate finance (MoEFCC, 2023).",
          "Capacity building is a tremendous need. A survey done by NIRDPR (2019) reported that only 10% of Primary Revenue Institutions (PRI) facilitators had received any form of training on climate adaptation (NIRDPR, 2020). PRIs cannot access funds such as the ₹364.35 crore NAFCC (MoEFCC, 2023), or take advantage of schemes under the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) without training on proposal writing, budgeting, and co-ordination between departments. For example, in PM-KUSUM which aims for 30.8GW solar capacity for rural areas where the scheme is not fully exploited due to incomplete integration at sub-state levels (MNRE, 2022).",
          "Working alongside NGOs, private Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actors and experts in the field can lead to lessons that improve climate adaptations at the grassroots. Two pilot programs in Odisha and Maharashtra demonstrated a 25–30% increase in the proportion of climate-related spending in the budgetary allocation and enabled a better relationship with communities (Vij et al., 2024).",
          "Since India suffers $87 billion in economic losses due to climate disasters every year (World Bank, 2021), investing in the PRIs is a compelling strategy. As greater training, access to financial resources and inclusive planning is developed, PRIs can take the transformational lead in locally-driven sustainable climate action."

    conclusion: [
      "Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) act as the agents of local climate action. Localizing climate action through PRIs is not merely a governance issue, it is an evolution needed in India’s climate framework. This report shows that, in spite of the NAPCC laying out a well-planned national strategy, this does not translate into action at the local level, partly due to issues like fragmentation of institutions for climate action, capacity, disjointed pathways to funds, and limited community engagement.",
      "The findings indicated a significant shift in the climate governance architecture of India away from a top-down policy delivery model towards building bottom-up resilience. The Panchayats must not only be perceived as implementers of climate action, but as recognized climate decision-makers. For this milestone to materialize, state and central governments have to work to catalyze knowledge transfer and to build technical capacity, with participatory governance models that are forged from the local experience.",
      "To achieve the tipping point of SDG 13 (Climate Action) at scale is to ensure that the lowest tiers of governance are empowered. With climate considerations integrated into Local plans and PRIs as active actors in the climate response, India will be on a pathway to building resilient rural communities that are ready not only to survive the climate crisis, but to spearhead effective resistance against it."

    abstract: [
      "The rapid digitalisation and expansion of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India have brought mixed outcomes, particularly for informal sector workers. The digital divide is a result of existing inequalities in socioeconomic status, geography, caste, and gender. While digitalisation has improved access in many areas, its benefits remain unevenly distributed. This paper investigates structural and systemic factors behind this gap and explores legal frameworks and the PPP model to promote financial inclusion.",
      "Using qualitative analysis of secondary data, this study finds that access to digital services remains uneven, for informal workers with low digital skills and sporadic access to the internet. It underscores spatial divide, limitations of the “one-size-fits-all” approach and the lack of legal protection in labour codes. It also reveals disparities within the informal sector, where MSME owners benefit from DPI but many workers remain excluded.",
      "Key recommendations include a universal legal definition for informal workers, rural digital awareness, government digital hubs under PPP model, and simplified user-centric e-portals designed with principle of privacy. Bridging the digital divide needs inclusive policy reforms to improve access to DPI across the Indian informal economy."

      "“Digital public infrastructure is not just about technology—it is about enabling equal access, empowering every citizen, and laying the digital rails for inclusive growth.”",
      "Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys and founding Chairperson of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)",
      "A world that becomes increasingly interconnected is finding a potent force in its ability to influence the way that governments, businesses, and individuals transact and interact through Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). The most significant ones are the digital identity and payment system and the data exchange layers, which are creating preconditions of efficient and inclusive service provision at scale. They are materialised in India through Aadhaar, UPI, DigiLocker, e-SHRAM, and ONDC, which form the heart of digital governance and the economy of the country.",
      "To appreciate the actual effects of DPI is to look at how it interacts with India’s informal economy, which itself constitutes more than 90% of the labour force and almost 50% of its GDP. The unorganised sector in India is the consequence of certain structural limitations like low capital formation, as well as regional disparities and a failure of formal infrastructure to absorb the increasing labour. These are the workers who work in this unorganised sector—daily wagers, domestic help, street vendors, artisans, and micro-entrepreneurs—and they may not have a formal contract/right, legal protection, access to credit, or social security. That’s why they’re not immune from abuse, economic shocks, and generation span poverty. The emergence of DPI represents a chance to close such a historic gap, although its achievement is not automatic and homogenous. The most frequent obstacle is a digital divide, particularly the rural-urban, gender, and income-related ones. Although the mobile connectivity and smartphone penetration have been enhanced, the problem is that digital access and digital literacy are still skewed, especially among women and elderly and marginalised groups. This digital divide affects financial inclusion directly. The Indian fintech revolution has resulted in women still having limited access to digital payment systems, access to formal credit, and ownership of assets, highlighting the importance of the design of DPI to be gender-sensitive.",
      "Another factor behind the DPI story in India is a well-functioning model of public-private partnerships (PPP), where the government makes core infrastructure (e.g., Aadhaar and UPI), and private actors develop applications and services on top. This model makes innovation possible at scale and checks its oversight by the public. But to have any lasting effect on livelihoods, DPI should do more than just enable transactions. It is supposed to allow the informal workforce to get access to new markets (such as ONDC for the local sellers), employment opportunities, generate credit histories, and access government schemes through websites such as e-SHRAM.",
      "Meanwhile, a fast rate of digitisation of citizen information presents important legal and regulatory questions, especially in regard to data privacy and surveillance, informed consent, and risks of exclusion. Data localisation norms, grievance redressal systems, and the Personal Data Protection Act need to dynamically advance along with the implementation of DPI to safeguard the rights of the informal labour force. The following paper focuses on the multidimensionality of the interaction of DPI in reconstituting the informal economy of India. It examines the position of dominant industries in the informal space, e.g., retail, construction, domestic services, and gig work, and the impact that DPI has on their inclusion, productivity, and resilience. The study will examine the major policy interventions, usage patterns, and current obstacles in order to present practical solutions towards an inclusive digital future.",

          "The aim of this research paper is to comprehensively examine the varying stages of digital transformation across the country, with an explicit concentration on the function and consequences of digital public infrastructure on various aspects of society, with special reference to the informal sector. Our questions seek to understand both the drivers and consequences of digital access and usage patterns, while also considering systemic elements within the DPI ecosystem. This report is guided by the following research questions.",
          "How do socio-economic and contextual factors influence the patterns of access to and effective utilisation of digital public infrastructure by different informal sector subgroups, and what are the resulting effects on their outcomes in knowledge acquisition, well-being, financial inclusivity, and the livelihoods of workers under various informal sector arrangements?",
          "To what extent do trends of privatisation, phantomization, and wealth accumulation within the Digital Public Infrastructure landscape, alongside the prevailing legal frameworks and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models, influence digital access and the ability of informal sector actors to leverage these technologies for their benefit, and how can these challenges be addressed?",
          "In line with the above-mentioned stratification hypothesis, we argue that variations in access to and use of technology are reproducing themselves, which in turn are exacerbating realworld disparities. This has restricted the ability of the digitally disadvantaged to access resources and fully reap the benefits of the virtual world."

          "UNDERSTANDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE",
          "OECD defines the digital divide as a gap across various socioeconomic levels in the use of ICTs and internet usage. It results from several factors, such as gender, affordability, location, and digital literacy. Only 31% of the rural population uses the internet, compared to 67% in urban areas (Oxfam India, 2022). Laskar (2023) shows an existing divide between urbanrural and intra-urban, causing limited digital access and technology-based skills, while Vaidehi et al. (2020) found low internet access, usage, and digital literacy in marginalised communities.",
          "Digitalisation has benefited some while excluding a large section of society (Dubey et al., 2024). These gaps persist despite government initiatives like the Digital India campaign, JAM, and UPI (ILO, 2024), particularly impacting the wages of informal workers (Sengupta et al., 2021).",
          "FINANCIAL INCLUSION",
          " Monetary policy becomes more effective through increased interest rate influence on economic transactions (Mehrotra & Yetman, 2015; Patra, 2021).",
          "According to Gupta et al. (2017), digital transformation can improve GDP and fiscal policy. At the 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad, PM Modi emphasised joint efforts by women and men for prosperity and development (Balasubramaniam et al. 2021).",
          "Inclusive financial services, as recognised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), are key to social security and poverty (Bhandari 2018).",
          "According to Ghosh and Bhattacharya (2019), financial innovations have expanded services for women and underprivileged individuals.",
          "REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS",
          "Maiti and Khari (2023) discovered that as a country uses more digital technologies, informal firms shrink and then grow again. The finest digital tools assist informal enterprises in becoming legitimate in countries with robust legislation. If laws are weak, digital tools may make it tougher for informal labourers to get work. If they feel observed, informal workers may avoid digital tools.",
          "In Puttaswamy v. Union of India, the court upheld Aadhaar but ruled that everyone has the right to privacy. The judicial system must respect digital privacy and dignity for DPI to be trusted.",
          "According to A. Panagariya (2022), existing social protection legislation ignores DPI and commends the India Stack, a combination of open APIs and digital public goods, for regulation. Current labour rules don't protect informal gig workers since they ignore DPI.",
          "Data protection and privacy are first and foremost about ensuring personal data is used with consent and kept within India. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 draft, based on the recommendations of the Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee, sets these rules, with the Data Protection Board of India investigating data breaches and imposing fines up to 250 crore.",
          "Electronic signatures and contracts are legally validated by the Information Technology Act, 2000, defined under section 2(1) (p), ensuring the authenticity of digital documents. The controller of certifying authorities licenses digital signature providers.",
          "IMPACT ON LIVELIHOODS",
          "With the growth of technology, Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has risen as one of the determiners in enhancing the livelihoods of the informal workers in India. It has simplified the process of delivery of welfare programs and wage payments and minimised leakages of the transfer of benefits (Kshirsagar & Cleary, 2024).",
          "Indeed, ICRIER (2017) established that when Aadhaar is integrated with wage-paying systems, the underpayments and delays among workers have been materially reduced.",
          "With Aadhaar integration, the services of the middlemen were also minimised, and workers received government assistance and other necessary services directly (Muralidharan et al., 2020).",
          "DPI has also been beneficial to the stability of households, to better access the fundamental base of resources, including food and fuel (World Bank, 2018).",
          "Nevertheless, a part of the workforce still experiences an impediment caused by the ambiguity regarding the usage of the system or the cases of manipulation and misuse (Krishna, 2020).",
          "In general, DPI has made the outcomes of livelihood more robust.",
          "STATUS OF INFORMAL WORKER",
          "In their work Das, H., Gupta, A., & ILAVARASAN, V. (2025) found out that small business owners were highly benefited through the DPI model; UPI has helped them achieve stability and constant support in conducting their day-to-day activities.",

          "PUBLIC- PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) MODEL",
          "Bhatnagar (2004) points out that PPP enhances e-governance in resource-poor settings through digital literacy & CSCs. Few states land records were digitised, improving redressal mechanisms vis-à-vis the effective PPP model.",
          "Varun Sharma (2020) highlights that PPPs enable specific services, i.e., geo-tagged digital platforms. He mentions safeguards & digital literacy to prevent encroachment & empower informal sector workers.",
          "Rahul Mishra & Ritu Sharma (2022) explains the role of PPPs in providing welfare schemes like the e-Shram portal. He brings forth PPP in welfare like DBTs, better documentation, & transferring of benefits across states.",
          "The World Bank defines PPPs as legally structured, performance-based deals. It highlights India’s adoption of hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure, stressing the need for clear rules & regulations, transparency, accountability, & outcomes in informal sectors.",
          "Singh (2019) emphasises its role in bridging the gap through urban informal infrastructure delivery and the effectiveness that it brings to the ecosystem. Singh points out that while public funds are limited, private partners bring innovation & scale.",
          "Above resources, it emphasises how significant the PPP model is in present times & can be in the future w.r.t. providing services and goods effectively & efficiently, ensuring safety nets to informal workers & securing them from exploitation via legal bindings and mechanisms in PPP."

        heading: "METHODOLOGICAL OVERVIEW",
        paragraphs: [
          "The methodology used for conducting this analysis of this policy, Bridging the Divide: DPI in the Informal Sector, is a hybrid and integrative approach that includes secondary, qualitative, and, to an extent, quantitative means to meet the ends to comprehensively analyse the intersection of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and the informal sector in India. The foundations of the study actually rest on the secondary research, where a broader range of existing literature, policy documents, legal frameworks, academic articles, and government reports were taken deep into account and were consulted. These include key sources such as Oxfam, World Bank assessments, and the landmark legislations & acts like the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023), the Aadhar Act, and the IT Act (2000) that helped & allowed to map the evolution of the DPI and its practical implications on the informal workers. Complementary to this is the qualitative analysis that helped deep dive into the structural and contextual realities of these informal sectors. Rather than just relying on the data, the study explores issues like digital exclusion; systemic marginalisation, which is based on caste and gender; exploitation by private players; the phantomization of data, i.e., through databases like e-Shram; and gaps in digital literacy. Legal judgements like Puttaswamy v. Union of India are analysed qualitatively to interpret how privacy rights and data governance influence trust and participation in the digital ecosystems. Furthermore, the study to some extent integrates the basic quantitative insights to validate its claims, using the statistics to reflect the extent of digital access and the economic impact of DPI. Overall, this mixed methodology enriches the study by ensuring that secondary data provides a macro-policylevel perspective, in which the qualitative interpretation adds depth to socio-economic and political realities, and picked quantitative data underscores the scale of digital disparities and economic outcomes. This mixed approach is particularly well suited for policy analysis in the Indian informal sector, where diversity on the ground level and structural inequalities demand more than a single-method investigation. The methodology effectively captures the complexity of the DPI’s impact, showing how interventions of technology are backed by robust institutional support. Hence, the methodology reflects not only the researchers  intent to examine existing knowledge critically but also through a holistic lens.",

        paragraphs: [
          "UNDERSTANDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE",
          "The digital divide is a result of existing socioeconomic inequalities in society. Though more visible in rural areas, it is also prevalent in urban spaces, showcasing inequality between resource-rich and under-resourced communities. This reveals that infrastructure alone, without inclusive policies, cannot bridge this divide. ",
          "Marginalised communities remain excluded due to ingrained systemic barriers like castebased issues and digital literacy, widening the divide.",
          "Here the digital divide emerges as both a cause and a consequence of the societal divide. Its impact on the wages of the informal sector extends to family welfare, health, and education.",
          "The limited impact of initiatives like JAM and UPI shows disconnect in policy targets and implementation; without accountability and a holistic strategy involving the community, these initiatives risk deepening rather than bridging the divide.",
          "FINANCIAL INCLUSION",
          "The government and RBI have focused on financial inclusion by leveraging technology, improving infrastructure, and supporting financial literacy among informal sector workers and digitally excluded populations. Low-income populations hesitate to use DPI-enabled services due to tax concerns, which lower their financial activity in the formal economy, reducing their contribution to India’s GDP and economic development. For informal sector workers, financial inclusion must cover access to credit, insurance, and emergency funds. ",
          "These steps ensure digital financial inclusion becomes a driver of equity, supporting sustainable livelihoods and enabling broader socio-economic development across underserved communities. Financial inclusion under DPI ensures that informal sector workers and low-income groups access essential financial services like savings, loans, and insurance efficiently and transparently. Digital ID systems simplify know your customer (KYC) procedure and reduce customer verification costs, allowing financial institutions to deliver affordable and efficient services to low-income and rural populations with minimal infrastructure. Senior citizens often lack digital knowledge, making it difficult for them to access DPI platforms like telemedicine or pension services, which increase their vulnerability to online fraud and misinformation during financial or insurance scheme linking. Women in rural areas face many barriers in digital finance, like limited skills, low device ownership, poor literacy, and lack of documentation.",
          "REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS",
          "The legal and regulatory framework of digital public infrastructure can be defined as the infrastructure that helps to reduce the time, money, and efforts of citizens, businessmen, and institutions for transparency, accountability, and inclusive participation.",
          "The Aadhar card allows individuals to prove their identity via biometrics such as fingerprints and eye retina and facilitates access to digital public services and government benefits. The Unique Identification Authority of India was established, and the Aadhaar Act was passed for governing, ensuring transparency, accountability, and issue resolution",
          "The Payment and Settlement System Act was passed in 2007, and RBI regulations ensure operations, risk management, and licensing of payment providers. The RBI monitors transaction limits and business on boarding. Digital payment systems like UPI and Aadharlinked payment systems enable digital money transfers.",
          "IMPACT ON LIVELIHOODS",
          "Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) is also changing the way informal workers are supported in terms of their lives becoming easier in having access to welfare programs and employment-related information as well as crucial services that are provided by the government. Government initiatives such as authentication of Aadhaar cards and direct benefit transfers have also helped the government in ensuring timely payment of aid, as fewer individuals are required to mediate the payments. The e-Shram database and other similar ones have made it easier to map informal workers, particularly during emergencies like the COVID-19 one.",
          "Through its efficiency in delivery, DPI has enhanced transparency and accountability, which has facilitated the maintenance of basic income supplied to vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, even these advantages still have certain obstacles to implementing the developed system and accessing its services: augmented reality, limited digital skills, sporadic access to the internet, and hiccups that might lock numerous individuals out. DPI is most effective when combined with local recruitment, offline support, and support of institutions. Instead of being like a one-size-fits-all program, it is a platform that needs to be aligned to what workers are experiencing. How maximally DPI can reinforce livelihoods is eventually subject to the inclusiveness with which the program is fashioned and its efficiency anchored on the ground.",
          "STATUS OF INFORMAL WORKERS",
          "The informal sector in India is a very vast sector; it includes various forms of labour, workers, and small businesses that are not industrially formalised yet and operate in a very small area. There are various subgroups that have benefited from the DPI, but there are groups who are neglected or unable to utilise the service provided to them in the optimum manner. Small business owners benefited the most from the e-payment system; it gave them the sense of security to run their business from their home. But the informal sector does not only contain the small businesses; it also contains the vast labour sector, which includes all kinds of labourers (daily wage labourers, gig workers, street vendors, rickshaw pullers, glass industry workers, etc.) who are not literate or digitally illiterate. They are the people who face the difficulty of accessing digital forums the most. They are generally illiterate, come in under the poverty line, and have very minute access to various technological services. The digital inclusion of women, specifically for the women in rural areas, is significantly low and mostly linked to the socioeconomic barriers as well. While digital inclusion can prove to play an important role in women's social and economic upliftment, they face a significant amount of discrimination in access to technologies.",
          "PUBLIC- PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) MODEL",
          "According to the Government of India, the PPP is collaboration between public authorities and private entities for delivering infrastructure or services, with shared investment, risk, & responsibility.”",
          "The PPP model is evident due to the result of the scarce resources, as the government cannot fund and falls into deficit to meet the needs of India’s large population. PPP results in identifying the potential and performing effectively, giving back quality and quantity at the same time. What stands out is how the PPP model becomes human. It works at the best level where and when people know each other, where technology is elaborated in local languages, and where digital access is made less daunting. In a manner, it’s not just about raising infrastructure, but it’s about building comfort and confidence. The PPP model, if not regularised, can lead to exploitation, which mainly depends on who is providing it and where, which in turn can undervalue the significance of PPP in the informal sector. ",
          "The PPP model supports the informal workers via hard and soft infrastructure, providing incentives but does not tend to take into consideration the marginalisation that led to illiteracy & backwardness. Also, where people often lack documents and stable addresses, the PPP model can feel patchy many a time.",

        paragraphs: [
          "After intensively studying and analysing the concerns outlined above, we proposed the following recommendations:",
          "• There should be a universal legal definition for the informal workers, for formal recognition, legal security and access to welfare schemes.",
          "• Organise awareness drives at the rural-level through Panchayats, ASHA workers, and Anganwadi workers for both men and women about the digital schemes and also identify the challenges faced by them to cater them accordingly.",
          "• Simplify e-portals and offer interface in various regional and local languages to cater to the mass public.",
          "• Establish government digital hubs under PPP model, specifically designed to provide digital services to those without smartphones or internet access. These hubs to be staffed with local language speaking trained personnel.",
          "• Emphasises the need for user-centric design and usability of digital services, involving user-friendly interfaces, clear instructions, and features that cater to the specific needs of rural populations.",
          "• The government should adhere to the principle of privacy by design, which entails considering privacy from the outset when developing any digital platform, including applications, websites, or other digital public infrastructure.",
          "A systematic approach is essential to bridge the digital divide in the country. The informal sector requires government attention from the initial stages of creating an online account to sustained access and inclusion."

    conclusion: [
      "This paper examines the persistent digital divide and the exclusion of informal sector workers from accessing Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India. Despite initiatives like Jan Dhan, UPI, and E-Shram, many informal workers remain excluded due to deep-rooted socioeconomic and structural barriers. The paper highlights how digital access can serve as useful measure to formalise the informal sector, making it more visible and connected.",
      "Using secondary data, this paper reveals how digital connectivity affects informal workers socioeconomically. While DPI has benefited MSME owners, large proportion of informal workers, particularly women in rural areas still face exclusion because of limited digital literacy, deep-rooted social norms, and infrastructural gaps.",
      "This paper argues for an inclusive, systematic policy approach to address these challenges. Key recommendations include introducing a universal legal definition for informal workers, expanding digital awareness programs-especially for women in rural areas, setting up local digital hubs through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, simplification of e-portals and adherence to principle of privacy by design. Future research should explore the rural–urban digital divide within the informal sector more deeply and apply quantitative methods to measure DPI’s impact over time.",
      "In conclusion, DPI must be viewed not only as technological advancement but as a driver of inclusive growth and social equity. If implemented equitably, it can help achieve Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG 1 (poverty eradication), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals). Its aim should be to build an inclusive society across the country—not just a digitalised economy.",

    "India’s urban centers are experiencing rapid economic growth alongside persistent inequality,infrastructural deficits, and environmental stress. Despite extensive literature on urban economic growth in India, few studies have empirically examined how structural challenges such as demographic pressures, labor market inefficiencies, and environmental degradation simultaneously affect urban productivity across major cities. This study addresses this critical gap by employing a descriptive quantitative approach and a robust panel econometric framework to analyze how population growth, unemployment, and air quality influence GDP per capita in New Delhi and Mumbai from 2017 to 2023. Unlike prior research that treats urban centers as homogeneous, this paper captures the contrasting urban trajectories of India’s political and financial capitals using FMOLS, GLS, and Robust Least Squares to model both long-run equilibrium and short-run dynamics, while correcting for endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and cross-sectional dependence. The findings reveal a novel insight: while Mumbai gains from population-driven economic agglomeration, New Delhi suffers from growth-induced infrastructural strain. Unemployment remains a consistent drag on urban GDP in both cities, and, counterintuitively, higher pollution levels are linked with GDP growth highlighting India’s continued reliance on emission-intensive industries. These differentiated outcomes expose the limits of one-sizefits-all urban policy models. The study contributes new evidence to urban sustainability literature and proposes a multidimensional SDG 11-aligned policy roadmap that integrates job creation, environmental resilience, and inclusive infrastructure planning to reshape India’s urban future."

  intro: [
    "India’s rapid urbanization has resulted in a complicated combination of mixed severe inequalities and economic opportunities (1) (World Bank, 2024; UN-Habitat, 2020). As cities continue to grow in both size and influence, questions about their long-term sustainability, economic stability, and inclusivity have become more important than ever (Time, 2024). Among India’s urban centres, Delhi and Mumbai stand out as two of the most notable cities; both are not only megacities but also contrasting as development case studies. In India, Delhi is a political and administrative centre, whereas Mumbai serves as a financial capital and a major contributor to the GDP (MoHUA, 2021) of the country. Despite their strength, both cities struggle with severe economic, social, and infrastructure inequalities (TISS, 2022)."  
    ,"This research paper conducts the quantitative analysis using secondary data that looks at how the inequalities, infrastructure gaps, and economic difficulties interact in Delhi and Mumbai. This study intends to explore how these cities might move towards more sustainable urban futures (World Bank, 2024) by concentrating on measures like GDP contribution, transportation networks, and per capita income. The findings aim to offer evidence-based insights into the urban paradox—where inequality and economic growth coexist—and how specific approaches can help close the gap. Through this lens, the study adds to the larger conversation about creating more fair and better cities in India (UNHabitat, 2020) "

        heading:"1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY",
        paragraphs:[ 
         "Cities in India are growing rapidly in both size and impact. Urban areas are becoming hubs of innovation and economic activities (World Bank, 2024; UN-Habitat, 2020). However, a number of significant difficulties accompany this rapid progress. Many cities are struggling to keep up with the needs of their increasing population, leading to problems like traffic, housing shortages, poor infrastructure, and growing socioeconomic inequality (Time Magazine, 2024; MoHUA, 2021) ",
         "Two of the most well-known cities in the nation—Delhi and Mumbai—reflect this disparity (Satterthwaite & Mitlin, 2020). On the other hand, they stand for strength, development, and wealth. However, they also reveal a deep gap of how resources and opportunities are distributed. In these cities, luxurious skyscrapers often stand next to overcrowded slums. While some people enjoy modern amenities, many still do not have access to secure transportation, good-quality schools, or clean water (Bhan, 2019; TISS Urban Studies, 2022).",
         "As India moves towards building “smart” and “sustainable” cities, it becomes important to pause and ask: Who are we really building for? Can a city be considered as sustainable if its growth leaves many people behind (UN-Habitat, 2020; World Bank, 2024)? ",
         "In order to investigate these issues, this study thoroughly examines Delhi and Mumbai. It aims to understand how economic challenges, inequalities, and urban planning affect the future of these cities. By using real data and targeted analysis, the research hopes to offer insights that can help create more balanced, inclusive, and livable cities for everyone.",

        heading: "PROBLEM STATEMENT",
        paragraphs: [
                "The problem to be addressed through this study is that, despite India’s urbanization accelerating at a striking rate, cities like Delhi and Mumbai, which are critical junctions for national economic growth, still suffer from structural inequalities and imbalances, and there is a stark contrast between the life experienced by the rich and the poor population groups. Recent evidence has shown unequal access to decent housing and basic services like water facilities, public transportation and sanitation for the population living in slums because the city’s shelters are not adequate (ORF 2016). The wider this gap grows, the more it puts at risk what makes these cities feel alive and important. These ongoing gaps for basic services and affordability highlight a longterm problem in how these cities should be built and managed rather than a short-term goal of having enough to meet the demand. "  
      ,"If continue down this path of unequal and unsustainable ways of urban development, the impact will be serious and lasting. When poverty and lack of opportunity are present in certain parts of the city, they drag down the entire economy, and workers cannot reach their full potential, and the economic growth of the whole city is reduced by 1.5% (World Bank 2023). When basic services are not available, cities have to spend more on quick fixes and emergency care, which further drains money that could have helped in building sustainable roads and housing (ADB Urban Development). Although plenty of data exists, they are collected on incompatible spatial and temporal scales, and that is why they lack three key questions: Which missing services, like water lines, sewers, safe housing, etc., drive today’s inequalities (UN-Habitat 2022)? Where can each  4 rupee be spent to close the gap the fastest (World Bank 2023)? How will rising sea level and heat threats, along with future migration and financial constraints, help the cities still be on track for SDG 11 targets (IPCC)? Closing this gap needs on-the-ground surveys and municipalfinance, and further analysing the neighbourhood is the first step towards fair and cost-smart solutions (UNHabitat 2022; ADB 2019).

          "I. Theoretical Foundations of Urban Economic Growth",
            "Urban economic growth, especially in rapidly expanding economies like India, is increasingly shaped by the interplay between demographic pressure, labor market performance, and environmental quality. At the heart of this dynamic lies GDP per capita, a key indicator of urban productivity and living standards. Classical urban economic theory, notably Solow’s neoclassical growth model (Solow, 1956), suggests that capital accumulation and labor inputs are primary drivers of output, but under urban constraints, this relationship is increasingly moderated by environmental and social stressors. Similarly, endogenous growth theory (Romer, 1994) posits that human capital, innovation, and demographic composition play critical roles in sustaining long-term economic development, underscoring the significance of population growth and employment quality in shaping city-level prosperity."
          ,"II. Demographic Pressure and Population Growth",
          "Population growth, particularly in megacities like New Delhi and Mumbai, has been traditionally linked to economic agglomeration benefits such as scale economies, labor pooling, and innovation spillovers (Glaeser et al., 2008). However, empirical findings are mixed. While some studies argue that urban expansion stimulates economic output by expanding markets and labor force participation (UN-Habitat, 2020; World Bank, 2023), others highlight the diseconomies of scale overcrowding, infrastructure strain, and service shortfalls that suppress productivity and worsen inequality (Turok & McGranahan, 2013; MoHUA, 2023). In India, this duality is stark: population growth has fueled both informal employment and slum proliferation, raising concerns over inclusive and sustainable development."
         ,"III. Urban Labor Market and Unemployment Dynamics",
          "Unemployment, especially within urban informal economies, is another crucial determinant of urban GDP. Labor market disruptions, skill mismatches, and underemployment particularly among youth reduce productivity, consumer demand, and economic resilience (ILO, 2023). Prior studies (e.g., Singh & Sharma, 2022; Anbumozhi et al., 2023) affirm the adverse effects of joblessness on urban  5 welfare, yet few disaggregate these effects across cities or examine how these dynamics evolve over time within metropolitan contexts. Moreover, the informal sector employing over 75% of India’s urban workforce remains underexplored in its relationship with GDP fluctuations, making urban unemployment a critical yet under-analyzed node in sustainable development discourse. "
        ,"IV. Environmental Degradation and Air Quality",
        "Air quality, proxied by the Air Quality Index (AQI), is increasingly recognized as both a consequence and a constraint of urban economic growth. According to ecological urbanism (Mostafavi & Doherty, 2010), unchecked urban expansion often results in ecological degradation, which in turn diminishes human productivity, increases health expenditures, and widens spatial inequality. Empirical studies (WHO, 2023; CPCB, 2024) confirm strong links between high AQI levels and decreased labor output, cognitive impairments, and increased mortality in urban India. However, recent paradoxes have emerged pollution-intensive sectors like construction and logistics often correlate positively with GDP growth in the short run (World Bank, 2023), revealing the trade-offs between industrial growth and ecological well-being. This contradiction remains inadequately explored in city-level studies, where the spatial-economic consequences of pollution are often generalized or overlooked. "
        ,"V. Empirical and Methodological Gaps",
          "Despite the growing body of urban development literature, several research gaps persist. First, few studies provide a comparative city-level assessment of how population growth, unemployment, and air quality jointly impact GDP per capita over time. Most analyses rely on national or state-level data, masking intra-urban disparities. Second, there is a lack of integrated frameworks that link these structural variables within a sustainability and inequality lens, particularly in India’s most dynamic metropolitan regions. Third, many empirical studies rely on either static or outdated datasets, often pre-dating critical disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby missing recent structural shifts in labor markets and environmental health (NITI Aayog, 2023; IQAir, 2024)."
      ,"VI. Contribution of the Present Study",
          "This study addresses these gaps by providing a city-specific, multidimensional investigation of the economic, demographic, and environmental determinants of urban GDP in New Delhi and Mumbai two cities emblematic of India’s urban contradictions. Unlike prior studies that isolate individual factors, this research reveals how population growth, unemployment, and AQI interactively shape urban economic performance, offering a richer, data-driven narrative of metropolitan development. The focus on post-2017 trends add contemporary relevance, while the emphasis on spatial differentiation highlights the asymmetrical impacts of urban stressors. In doing so, the study contributes novel insights into how structural variables often treated separately collectively influence sustainable urban futures, with direct relevance to SDG 11 on inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities. By moving beyond generalized national narratives and providing granular empirical evidence for India’s two leading urban economies, this research deepens scholarly and policy understanding of the urban development paradox: that economic growth, when unaccompanied by environmental and labor reforms, can reinforce rather than resolve urban inequality"

          "Description, Units and Data Sources of Variables",
          "2. Analytical Framework",
          "This study adopts a robust panel econometric approach to examine how economic, demographic, and environmental variables shape urban sustainability in New Delhi and Mumbai. Guided by urban economic theory (Solow, 1956; Glaeser et al., 2008), endogenous growth theory (Romer, 1994), and ecological urbanism (Mostafavi & Doherty, 2010), the core variables GDP per capita, population growth rate, unemployment rate, and air quality index (AQI) were selected for their critical roles in  7 reflecting productivity, demographic pressure, labour market conditions, and environmental health. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation established data patterns and inter-variable associations. Panel unit root tests (PP, LLC) and cointegration tests (Pedroni, Kao, Johansen) confirmed data stationarity and long-run relationships. FMOLS was used for estimating long-term effects, addressing endogeneity and serial correlation. GLS and robust least squares captured short-run dynamics and corrected for heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence. VIF ensured multicollinearity was not present, and the Wald test confirmed model stability and overall significance. This integrated framework ensures empirical rigor and theoretical alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 11, offering a multidimensional view of the drivers of inequality and sustainable urban futures in India’s leading metropolitan cities. The equation for the estimated models is formulated below: "
          ,"GDP PER CAPITAit = α0 + β1POP_RATEi𝑡 + β2 UNEMPi𝑡 + β3 AQIi𝑡 + 𝑢it",
          "In the specified panel data framework, t represents the time dimension, and i denotes the crosssectional units (New Delhi and Mumbai). The constant term α0 captures the intercept, while β1 to β3 represent the coefficients for the explanatory variables: population growth rate (POP_RATE), unemployment rate (UNEMP), and air quality index (AQI). GDP per capita (GDPPC) functions as the dependent variable, capturing the economic trajectory of urban centres and 𝑢it represent infinte residuals. The Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) estimator is adopted for modelling long-run relationships under cointegration, effectively correcting for serial correlation and endogeneity, thereby ensuring consistent and efficient parameter estimates (Phillips & Hansen, 1990; Stock & Watson, 1993)."
          ,"To account for heteroskedasticity and potential cross-sectional dependence, the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) method is employed, offering improved efficiency over Ordinary Least Squares when error variances are non-constant (White, 1980). Additionally, the Robust Least Squares (RLS) estimator is utilized to mitigate the influence of outliers and leverage points, providing resistant and reliable parameter estimates, especially under data irregularities common in urban economic datasets (Rousseeuw & Leroy, 1987). The integration of these estimators creates a comprehensive and resilient econometric strategy to examine the complex interplay of economic, demographic, and environmental factors driving sustainable urban development in India’s leading metropolitan centers "
          ,"The cointegration test is based on the following hypothesis ",
          "Но: -1 = 81-71 = $1=$1=0 This implies no co-integration.",

          "Table 2 descriptive statistics for New Delhi and Mumbai from 2017 to 2023 exhibited significant variation in socio-economic and environmental indicators. The average GDP per capita growth rate was 14.29%, with a high standard deviation and negative skewness indicating uneven economic performance, likely shaped by pandemic shocks and sectoral imbalances (World Bank, 2023; Sachs et al., 2023). Population growth, averaging 2.14%, reflects sustained urban in-migration and density challenges (MoHUA, 2023). The unemployment rate ranged widely, with a mean of 5.29%, revealing structural labour market weaknesses, especially in the informal sector (ILO, 2023). Critically, the Air Quality Index (AQI) averaged 4722, signalling persistent environmental distress despite national interventions like the NCAP (CPCB, 2024). These trends highlight the need for balanced urban strategies that integrate inclusive growth, employment stability, and environmental sustainability ",
          "Table 3 Stationarity Test",
          "The table 3 panel unit root tests using both Phillips-Perron (PP) and Levin, Lin & Chu (LLC) methodsCconfirm that GDP per capita, population growth, unemployment, and Air quality index are non-C9Cstationary at level I(0) but become stationary after first differencing I(1), as all variables showCsignificant p-values at both 5% and 1% levels at first difference.

          ,"Table 4 Correlation Matrix",
          "Table 4 correlation analysis for New Delhi and Mumbai (2017–2023) highlights key urban development linkages. GDP per capita has a weak negative correlation with unemployment (-0.20) and population growth (-0.01), suggesting that economic gains have not translated into inclusive job creation. In contrast, population growth is strongly correlated with Air quality index (0.98) and unemployment (0.68), indicating that rapid urbanization is driving both environmental stress and labor market pressure (MoHUA, 2023; CPCB, 2024). The positive link between unemployment and AQI (0.60) further reflects how poor environmental conditions may worsen urban livelihood challenges. These patterns call for integrated urban strategies that link economic growth with environmental sustainability and employment equity (World Bank, 2023; NITI Aayog, 2024) "

These  10 findings reject the null of no cointegration, confirming that the variables move together over time despite short-term fluctuations.

A 1% increase in unemployment causes a 17.97% drop in GDP, highlighting the drag of labor market inefficiencies (ILO, 2023). A 1-unit rise in AQI is linked to a 16.54% increase in GDP, indicating growth driven by pollution-heavy sectors like construction and industry (CPCB, 2024; World Bank, 2023).

Although population growth shows a negative coefficient –3.95, it is statistically insignificant p = 0.11 suggesting variability in demographic-economic dynamics.

In contrast, a 1% increase in unemployment rate leads to a 0.49% decrease in GDP per capita at 5% significant level , highlighting the critical role of job creation in sustaining urban economic performance and poverty reduction (ILO, 2023). Additionally, although the coefficient of AQI is close to zero, it is statistically significant at 1% level, suggesting that even marginal increases in pollution correlate with GDP growth likely reflecting economic activities concentrated in high-emission sectors such as transport and construction (CPCB, 2024; World Bank, 2023).

Similarly, a 1% rise in unemployment lowers GDP by 0.33% at 5% significant level, reflecting vulnerability in the city’s informal job market (ILO, 2023). Notably, air pollution (AQI) shows a statistically significant yet numerically negligible positive association with GDP, indicating continued reliance on pollutionintensive growth sectors (CPCB, 2024). In contrast, Mumbai shows a positive effect of population growth on GDP per capita 7.27% at 5% significant level, suggesting effective urban agglomeration  13 benefits and economic absorption capacity. However, unemployment and AQI are not statistically significant, implying other structural factors may drive Mumbai’s GDP growth, such as financial services and logistics.

        paragraphs: [
          "The present study, rooted in the broader discourse on sustainable urbanization and spatial inequality in India, sought to examine how key structural variables population growth, unemployment, and air quality impact GDP per capita in two of India’s most economically and demographically significant cities: New Delhi and Mumbai. Framed within the context of India’s accelerating urbanization and the uneven distribution of urban opportunities (UN-Habitat, 2020; World Bank, 2024), this research responds to a critical gap in the literature by quantifying how these factors interact to shape urban economic outcomes over time. The empirical analysis, based on panel FMOLS, GLS, and robust least squares estimations from 2017 to 2023, uncovers important patterns that advance understanding of the urban development paradox where economic growth often coexists with deep-seated inequality and infrastructural stress.",  
          "One of the central findings from the estimation models is the divergent influence of population growth on GDP between New Delhi and Mumbai. While the background of the study emphasized concerns over urban congestion, housing shortages, and service deficits (MoHUA, 2021; TISS, 2022), the empirical evidence affirms that these demographic pressures are not uniform in effect. In New Delhi, population expansion aligns with structural strain, suggesting insufficient urban planning and poor integration of new residents into formal economic systems. In contrast, Mumbai appears to channel population growth more effectively into economic productivity, likely due to its historical development as a dense financial and commercial hub with relatively stronger infrastructure and agglomeration economies (World Bank, 2024). This reinforces the research objective of identifying city-specific structural capacities and limitations influencing urban economic performance." 
          ,"The analysis further reveals that unemployment exerts a consistently negative effect on GDP in both cities across models. This supports the study’s assertion that labor market inefficiencies remain a major drag on urban economic resilience and inclusiveness. Previous studies and reports from the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2023) and NITI Aayog have highlighted persistent underemployment, skill mismatches, and informality in urban labor markets especially in Delhi, where rapid population inflows outpace job creation. The findings align with real-world developments in India’s post-pandemic urban economy, where jobless growth and widening income gaps have intensified urban vulnerability (NITI Aayog, 2023). These outcomes validate the study’s hypothesis that employment remains a critical determinant of sustainable urban development and reinforce calls for labour-intensive and inclusive policy reforms.", 
          "A notable new insight emerging from the empirical results is the complex relationship between environmental degradation measured through AQI and GDP. Although the literature often emphasizes the adverse health and productivity costs of pollution (CPCB, 2024; WHO, 2023), the positive correlation observed in some models reflects an unsettling real-world pattern: that urban economic growth in Indian megacities continues to be propelled by pollution-intensive industries such as construction, transport, and low-regulation manufacturing. This suggests that economic expansion remains environmentally unsustainable, particularly in New Delhi, where the air quality crisis is among the world’s worst (IQAir, 2024). The findings challenge conventional growth paradigms and align with recent policy critiques emphasizing the urgency of green transitions and climate-resilient infrastructure investments in urban India (World Bank, 2023; IPCC, 2023).", "Overall, the results of this study make a substantial contribution by empirically validating the complex and differentiated roles of population dynamics, employment, and environmental conditions in shaping urban economic outcomes. The findings not only confirm long-standing policy concerns but also provide updated, data-driven evidence that can inform targeted urban planning, labor market interventions, and environmental governance. As India positions itself toward achieving SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities the contrasting experiences of New Delhi and Mumbai offer valuable lessons. These cities must go beyond GDP-focused metrics and integrate equity, resilience, and sustainability into their urban development models. Future policy frameworks must prioritize inclusive employment generation, strategic infrastructure expansion, and environmentally responsible growth pathways to ensure that economic transformation does not come at the cost of urban well-being or ecological degradation.

    conclusion: [
      "This study offers a timely and nuanced understanding of how population growth, unemployment, and air quality interact to influence urban economic performance in New Delhi and Mumbai two of India’s most vital yet structurally divergent megacities. By integrating demographic, labor market, and environmental variables over the 2017–2023 period, this research fills critical empirical gaps left by previous studies, which often treated these variables in isolation or failed to disaggregate urban dynamics at the city level. The findings not only confirm long-standing policy concerns such as the economic drag of rising unemployment and unsustainable pollution-led growth but also uncover city-specific responses to demographic pressures, showing that the same variable can have opposite effects depending on urban governance capacity and economic structure.", "The novelty of this study lies in reframing urban growth not just as a macroeconomic challenge, but as a systems-level issue where labor absorption, environmental limits, and demographic integration must be simultaneously addressed. Unlike conventional analyses, this research demonstrates that economic growth in urban India is increasingly contingent on its ability to decouple productivity from pollution and to absorb growing populations into sustainable, formal employment channels."

      "This study explores the psychosocial consequences of emotional suppression and adherence to traditional masculine norms among young men in India.",
      "Using a sample of 79 Indian men aged 18–25, the study employed the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory-22 (CMNI-22) and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) to assess internalized norms and emotional regulation strategies.",
      "Results indicated a high degree of conformity to norms such as risk-taking, emotional control, dominance, and self-reliance, alongside elevated scores for expressive suppression.",
      "The findings highlight a significant link between emotional suppression and challenges such as heightened psychological distress, strained relationships, and reluctance to seek help.",
      "These outcomes underscore the urgent need for culturally sensitive mental health interventions, emotional education, and a redefinition of masculinity that validates emotional expression.",
      "Such efforts are critical to improving mental health outcomes and interpersonal well-being among Indian men."

    intro: [
      "Over 70% of suicide deaths in India are men, not because they feel they are less but because they have been taught to show less. Behind these numbers there is this cultural script that rewards emotional control and punishes vulnerability.",
      "From a young age, Indian boys are taught that emotions like sadness, fear, and tenderness are signs of weakness and they can't be weak. These aren't just short-lived lessons, they become the foundation of how boys see themselves and the world around them.",
      "Masculinity, especially in South Asia, means strength, dominance and emotional control. These ideas are reinforced at home, in schools, through media and even with peer groups. A boy who cries might be bullied or scolded. Over time emotional suppression becomes second nature, since they have been conditioned to do it.",
      "This learned silence has serious consequences. Emotional Suppression doesn't only limit personal growth it also affects their mental health. While both men and women in India suffer from anxiety and depression at a similar rate, men tend to seek less help or even recognize that they are struggling.",
      "As the stigma around emotions persists, many men internalize their distress until it changes into aggression, substance abuse or in worst cases suicide.",
      "This article explores psychosocial consequences of emotional suppression as learned behaviour particularly in young Indian men. Drawing from psychological frameworks like Social Learning Theory and Gender Schema Theory, it unpacks emotional restraint through generations."

        paragraphs: [
          "In order to grasp the full scope of the changes that occurred within masculinity, one would need to look at the shifts both materially and ideologically. Dominance, physical strength, and the ability to provide protection were the defining traits of masculinity in early agrarian and warrior societies.",
          "The rise of capitalism and industrialization in the 18th and 19th century marked a defining change in this aspect and resulted in men being labeled as 'breadwinners.' The economic transformation brought about a change in societal structure.",
          "One foundational framework is the theory of Hegemonic Masculinity (Connell, 1987, 2005). This model posits that masculinity is not a singular, fixed identity but a hierarchical structure where certain forms are culturally privileged over others.",
          "Masculine Role Norms Theory (Brannon, 1976) explains the set behavioral expectations for men through 4 core scripts: 'No Sissy Stuff', 'The Big Wheel', 'The Sturdy Oak', and 'Give 'Em Hell'.",
          "Pleck's Gender Role Strain Paradigm (1981, 1995) explains that men often undergo strain in trying to fulfill these masculine norms, leading to 'discrepancy strain' and 'dysfunction strain'.",
          "More recent work, such as Inclusive Masculinity by Anderson (2009), observes that young people, especially in western metropolitan areas, tend to accept aspects such as emotional vulnerability, intimacy, and non-violent ways of resolving disputes as part of the male identity."

        heading: "MASCULINITY SCRIPTS IN THE INDIAN CONTEXT",
        paragraphs: [
          "Masculinity in India doesn't follow a single template, it shifts across regions, religions, castes, and generations. But there are some recurring patterns. At the core of many traditional ideals is the idea that a man should provide, protect, and above all, stay emotionally contained.",
          "In upper-caste Hindu settings, masculinity has often been shaped by Brahmanical patriarchy (Chakravarti, 1993). This model frames the ideal man as calm, controlled, sexually restrained, and emotionally distant.",
          "Dalit masculinity, for example, has developed very differently, often in active resistance to these dominant upper-caste norms. Sarkar (2017) highlights how, for many Dalit communities, masculinity is tied to assertiveness, defiance, and collective pride.",
          "Bollywood has done as much as any institution to shape how Indian men imagine themselves. Think of the brooding, vengeful hero of the 70s or today's action-packed, hyper-muscular stars. These characters rarely show vulnerability.",
          "Among young men today, especially in urban India, there's a visible push and pull. Studies like Verma and Mahendra's (2004) show how many feel stuck between what the world is telling them—be open, seek therapy, talk about mental health—and what their families or peer groups still reinforce: real men don't show weakness."

        paragraphs: [
          "From early childhood, boys are taught both directly and indirectly that emotions such as sadness and fear are signs of weakness. These teachings don't have a short-term impact. Over time, repeated reinforcement through observation and social feedback makes these actions emotionally ingrained habits.",
          "Albert Bandura's social learning theory explains that children learn behaviours by watching other people, especially the people they look up to (Bandura, 1977). When a boy gets scolded for 'crying', praised for being 'strong' and teased for being sensitive, he learns which emotions are acceptable and which are not.",
          "In the Indian context, social learning starts in early childhood. A report by Save the Children India states that 70% of boys between the ages of 6-12 have been told not to cry by their parents and teachers (Save the Children, 2022).",
          "Sandra Bem's Gender Schema Theory helps us understand how children internalize gender experience (Bem, 1981). In India, 'masculine schema' typically refers to strength, domination, and emotional control.",
          "The media plays a massive role in strengthening this behaviour. Indian cinema has also portrayed the emotionally unavailable male leads who are calm under pressure and violent when hurt, but they are never vulnerable.",
          "In India, the boys who show vulnerability often face bullying or are given homophobic names like chakka or meetha, which show their femininity. Despite the growing conversations on the topic of mental health, there is still a literacy and research gap when it comes to emotional suppression in Indian men."

          "One of the most common outcomes of long-term emotional suppression is anxiety. A study by Singh (2023) found that college-going men who scored high on emotional suppression also showed significantly elevated signs of social anxiety and restlessness.",
          "Suppressed sadness often doesn't disappear—it just shows up in different ways. For many men, it appears as depression, though it may not look like the kind we often hear about.",
          "This emotional distance also takes a toll on relationships. Many young Indian men find it difficult to form close bonds—be it with friends, partners, or even family.",
          "Emotions that are pushed down don't always stay quiet. For some men, they come out as anger or aggression. Instead of crying or admitting sadness, some young men lash out, raise their voices, or even become physically aggressive.",
          "Coping mechanisms also include substance use, which becomes a common outlet for pain that cannot be spoken. Alcohol, smoking, or drug use serve as numbing agents, offering short-term relief but worsening emotional health over time.",
          "What's often overlooked is that emotional suppression doesn't just affect the mind—it affects the body. Men who suppress their emotions frequently report physical symptoms like headaches, stomach problems, or constant fatigue.",
          "Perhaps the most heartbreaking consequence of emotional suppression and masculine expectations is the risk of suicide. In 2021 alone, over 72% of suicide victims in India were men, according to the NCRB."

          "Among adolescent and college-aged boys, friendships often center on shared activities like sports or games, rarely fostering true emotional openness. Vulnerabilities, such as sadness or fear, are usually discouraged, either subtly through teasing or simply via silence.",
          "In educational and professional settings, the performance of masculinity requires a display of confidence and composure, even when young men are experiencing significant distress. Emotional expression is often wrongly viewed as a sign of weakness.",
          "Public displays of emotion, like crying, expressing affection, or seeking counseling, continue to be highly policed within peer groups and communities. Young men who act contrary to these norms often encounter derogatory labeling.",
          "To escape judgment and maintain peer approval, many young men find themselves imitating dominant masculine behaviors, even those at odds with their personal values. This often leads to the suppression of nurturing or emotionally expressive aspects of their identity.",
          "A significant but less visible consequence is men's ongoing avoidance of caregiving or emotional labor. These are the roles that are traditionally designated as 'feminine' in Indian families."

          "Rigid masculine norms significantly dictate not only which emotions young men are permitted to express but also how they manage emotional pain.",
          "Many young men often turn to alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs as a way to cope with their repressed emotions. These substances act as temporary escape routes, providing a brief sense of relief from emotional pain.",
          "It's pretty common for a lot of young men to think that sharing their feelings or reaching out for emotional support means they're weak. Because of this mindset, they often keep their distance from others, avoid deep conversations, and instead dive into solitary activities.",
          "To protect their sense of masculinity from perceived threats, young men may engage in exaggerated displays of masculinity. This could mean asserting dominance, taking risks, or trying to control social situations.",
          "Suppressing our sadness or anxiety can really affect how we behave—leading to irritability, sudden outbursts, or even aggressive actions. This not only hurts our connections with others but also creates a pattern where anger seems to be the only emotion we can express freely without fear of judgment.",
          "Our bodies often bear the burden of emotions we keep bottled up. Young men, in particular, may find themselves grappling with chronic fatigue, headaches, stomach problems, or just a general sense of discomfort, all without any obvious medical reason.",
          "As young men try to find a balance between their emotional needs and what society expects of them, they often face some serious internal struggles. Many cope by minimizing their feelings—thinking, 'others have it worse'—or by simply pretending those feelings aren't there.",
          "When emotions are kept under wraps, it can really affect how we relate to others. Young men who find it tough to be vulnerable often struggle with intimacy, trust, and the emotional give-and-take in their family, romantic, and friendship dynamics."

          "Targeted interventions can help: encourage emotional literacy as boys grow up; make vulnerability a normal part of interactions among male peers and within families; challenge harmful stereotypes about masculinity that are prevalent in homes, schools, and the media; tackle mental health issues like anxiety and relationship struggles that arise from emotional suppression.",
          "School and Community-Based Programs: Set up emotional education programs that guide boys in recognizing and expressing a full spectrum of emotions; host peer support workshops that foster safe environments for young men to open up about their feelings without the worry of being judged.",
          "Family-Oriented Interventions: Start initiatives to help parents understand the long-term mental health impacts of bottling up emotions; create father-son initiatives that encourage open emotional expression in daily life.",
          "Mass Media and Pop Culture Engagement: Shine a light on positive, emotionally expressive male role models in movies and TV shows; create social media campaigns with youth influencers to spread important messages about mental health and embracing healthy masculinity.",
          "Mental Health Services: Make sure that young people in schools have better access to counseling services; provide therapy that respects and understands the diverse gender norms and regional differences across India.",
          "Policy Recommendations: Let's start by introducing gender-sensitization training across all institutions; it's crucial to make sure that the mental health of boys and men is part of public health programs, complete with its own funding.",
          "Comprehensive interventions across various levels can lead to: enhanced mental health, with reduced rates of anxiety, depression, and substance abuse; young men improving their relationship skills, which nurtures healthier friendships and family dynamics; a gradual transformation in the cultural narratives that shape our understanding of masculinity."

    conclusion: [

      "High conformity to norms such as risk-taking, emotional control, and self-reliance, coupled with elevated expressive suppression, underscores the deeply ingrained cultural expectations that prioritize stoicism over emotional expression.",
      "These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions that promote emotional literacy, challenge harmful stereotypes, and provide accessible mental health support tailored to the cultural context.",
      "Comprehensive efforts across educational, familial, media, and policy levels are essential to redefine masculinity in ways that validate emotional expression and foster psychological well-being.",
      "Future research should employ larger, more diverse samples and longitudinal designs to better understand the causal relationships between masculine norms, emotional regulation, and mental health outcomes.",
      "Ultimately, fostering a more inclusive and flexible understanding of masculinity can help reduce the stigma around emotional expression and help-seeking, leading to healthier individuals and communities."

    "This research critically examines the pressing need to recognize ecocide - defined as large-scale, long-term, and serious environmental destruction - as the fifth international crime in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC).",
    "Through a doctrinal and comparative legal approach, this paper assesses the historical development, moral underpinnings, and jurisdictional implications of articulating ecocide internationally.",
    "The paper seeks to demonstrate that ecocide endangers not only the environment, but human rights, world peace, and intergenerational justice, using case studies like the Bhopal gas leak and Deepwater Horizon oil spill to show insufficient legal responses.",
    "Ethically, criminalization is warranted by principles of ecocentrism and intergenerational justice. Legally, while challenges exist, the paper argues for amending the Rome Statute to include ecocide by utilizing Article 30's clause and amending mens rea to include recklessness.",
    "The research provides a policy platform including amending the Rome Statute, enacting domestic legislation, developing corporate accountability mechanisms, and integrating restorative justice.",
    "Recognizing ecocide as an international crime is legally possible and an ethical imperative for environmental sustainability, justice, and accountability for future generations."

      "The term ecocide—literally meaning the killing of the environment—has evolved from a moral outrage to a legally contested concept in international criminal law. The term came into meaning during the Vietnam War with the U.S. military’s use of Agent Orange, resulting in environmental ecological devastation.",
      "Though there is not a legally sanctioned definition of ecocide, it has flared up intermittently in law and political expressions. In 1972, Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme reduced environmental destruction as a possible international crime during the United Nations Conference on Human Environment.",
      "In the last decade, there has been a renewed interest in environmental destruction in the context of climate change, deforestation, and industrial pollution. The Stop Ecocide Foundation has launched a campaign for ecocide to be recognized as the fifth international crime within the Rome Statute.",
      "In 2021, an important milestone was reached when a panel of international legal experts defined ecocide as 'unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts.'",
      "The history of the ecocide concept reflects the increasing urgency to create mechanisms to face transboundary environmental damage through law, forming the intersection of environmental science, morality, and international law as a reaction to the ongoing ecological crisis worldwide."

          "Ecosystems, human health, and the boundaries of the planet are all under threat from the unprecedented scale of environmental destruction. The planet is irreparably damaged by everything from large oil spills and the destruction of forests to industrial pollution and climate-altering emissions, frequently with no more than a token of legal penalty.",
          "Ecocide is not a crime under international law, a core legal loophole despite global initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression are within the purview of the Rome Statute but not serious environmental damage committed in peace times.",
          "The problem is compounded by the absence of a common definition of ecocide, enforcement procedure problems, and resistance from powerful political and economic actors. Environmental justice issues are severe at the international level due to the disproportionate effect on vulnerable groups, especially in the Global South and Indigenous communities.",
          "By examining the possibility of having ecocide as the fifth core crime under international law at the ICC, the study attempts to bridge the gap in law and norms on the topic.

Legal scholars and ethicists challenge the anthropocentric bias of traditional legal systems and argue for an ecocentric approach.",
          "The philosophical basis lies in the duty to preserve the integrity of the Earth and its ecosystems, not only for human beings but for non-human life and future generations. This principle finds roots in the ethics of intergenerational justice, championed by Hans Jonas in 'The Imperative of Responsibility'.",
          "The concept of deep ecology, developed by Arne Naess, insists on the intrinsic value of all living beings, regardless of their utility to humans. This justifies criminalising ecocide as a recognition of the ecocentric worldview — that ecosystems possess inherent rights and moral consideration.",
          "The ethical imperative transitions into a legal one when framed within the doctrine of public trust, which holds that natural resources are held in trust by the State for the benefit of current and future generations, as acknowledged in the Indian Supreme Court’s judgment in M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath.",
          "The ethical foundation also draws from cosmopolitan theories of global justice by philosophers like Thomas Pogge and Martha Nussbaum, who argue that justice transcends national borders, especially where environmental degradation threatens shared human futures.",
          "The precautionary principle, enshrined in the 1992 Rio Declaration, reinforces the urgency of preemptive action, holding that the absence of full scientific certainty should not justify postponing measures to prevent serious or irreversible environmental harm."

This maintains philosophical coherence with concepts of moral culpability and gross negligence.",

Legal philosopher Jeremy Waldron warns of the danger in conflating morality and law, where overzealous criminalisation may turn political dissent into prosecutable conduct. Critics also question the practicality of enforcing ecocide and proving intent.",

          "Modify The Rome Statute: The primary recommendation is to officially recognize ecocide as the fifth international crime using the 2021 expert definition. The incorporation of 'wanton' introduces recklessness, extending beyond the current mens rea in Article 30. This can be accomplished by applying the 'unless otherwise provided' clause in Article 30. The definition must be clarified using scientific metrics (e.g., hectares deforested, tonnes of pollutants) to enhance legal certainty.",
          "Promote National Legislation: Due to the complexity of amending the Rome Statute, domestic legislation must be enacted concurrently. France's 2021 'Climate and Resilience' Law and the EU's Directive 2024/1203, which enhances environmental criminal law, serve as examples. National statutes provide prompt legal remedies, facilitate the evolution of customary international law, and act as laboratories for legal innovation.",
          "Enforce Corporate Criminal Liability: A significant accountability deficit exists as the Rome Statute permits prosecution of individuals only, not corporations. A global treaty, such as the UN Treaty on Business and Human Rights, is necessary to establish binding corporate criminal liability for environmental offences, particularly for firms in high-risk sectors (fossil fuels, mining, industrial agriculture). Individual executives should also bear personal liability under a modified principle of command responsibility.",
          "Integrate Restorative Justice And Ecocentric Principles: Justice must go beyond prosecution to include rehabilitation. Restorative justice approaches should mandate offenders' involvement in environmental restoration (e.g., financing reforestation, clean water efforts). This adopts an ecocentric legal perspective, respecting the basic rights of nature, as seen in Bolivia’s Law of the Rights of Mother Earth, representing a necessary shift from a purely human-centric view in international law."
        ]

    ],
    conclusion: [
      "The acknowledgment of ecocide as an international crime signifies a vital and equitable advancement in international law. It would indicate that the international community no longer condones the wanton devastation of the Earth’s biosphere.",
      "The legal, ethical and jurisdictional obstacles to the adoption of ecocide under the Rome Statute are significant, however, not insurmountable. As scientific consensus increases, national legislation expands, and public acceptance grows, momentum is intensifying.",
      "The criminalisation of ecocide would safeguard both ecosystems and future generations. It would realign the international legal framework towards a more ecologically aware paradigm that appreciates nature not only for its service to humanity but for its intrinsic value.",
      "This would validate the notion that planetary justice is fundamental to peace, security and human existence. It is imperative for nations, courts, and communities to undertake this audacious yet essential action, recognizing environmental damage not merely as a policy failure, but as a grave criminal offence."

      "With the increasing environmental crisis across the globe, ecocide has achieved more widespread recognition and broader awareness. It is high time we recognised ecocide as 5th International Crime under the Rome Statute (International Criminal Court,1998) since the existing legal provisions lack regulations or frameworks.The focus is to solve the paradox of how destruction of the environment during a war is a crime, and the same destruction in peacetime is not considered a crime. The individuals or corporations must be held accountable for the collapse of biodiversity and the displacement of communities. This paper aims to examine the potential impact of criminalisation of ecocide and establish criminal liability for environmental harm by imposing sanctions and reinforcing justice. The cooperation between international organisations can help the authority to prosecute individuals, corporate leaders, and state actors responsible for large-scale environmental harm. We require political commitment and global cooperation for implementing ecocide laws and effective enforcement. Ecocide laws will drive corporations and individuals into adapting new and healthier ways that can hold polluters accountable and support in achieving the sustainable development goals 13, 14 and 15. Finally, the paper affirms a widespread support is needed to ensure that environmental havoc is no longer met with impunity but with justice."

      "From Agent Orange in Vietnam to oil-soaked rivers in the Niger Delta, from the choking gas of Bhopal to the melting corals of the Great Barrier Reef, severe environmental destruction occurs with impunity. While courts prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression, there is no international mechanism to categorise ecocide as a criminal act deserving of serious legal scrutiny. This is the void that the concept of ecocide seeks to fill.",
      "Ecocide, derived from the Greek word 'oikos' (home) and the Latin 'caedere' (to kill) literally means 'killing our home.' In 2021, a legal definition was drafted by an independent panel of jurists, considering it as 'unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts.'",
      "Currently, the international legal system lacks sufficient tools to prosecute those responsible for ecological destruction, and corporations and state actors often avoid criminal liability, facing only regulatory fines or civil litigation. Classifying ecocide as an international crime would elevate environmental preservation to a top-tier legal priority, marking a significant shift in the normative understanding of international law and serving as a preventative measure."

        "Despite a growing climate emergency and recurring environmental disasters happening like climate crises, mass deforestation, biodiversity collapse, and pollution-induced disasters, environmental crimes are not treated with theutmost urgency and gravity they deserve. Various States and multinational corporations often act with impunity,prioritising economic growth and profit over environmental sustainability, due to which vulnerable populations andecosystems suffer irreparable damage. The failure to include ecocide as an international crime within the RomeStatute leaves a glaring lacuna in international criminal law",
        "It offers a basis to shift environmental regulation from reactive damage control to proactive ecological protection. Though it has the potential to transform, ecocide is a legally unreconstructed and politically charged term. This research attempts to bridge the gap currently missing by examining the deterrent value, judicial potential,and institutional implications of criminalising ecocide",
        "This research aims to examine the potential impact of recognising ecocide as the fifth international crime in the Rome Statute. The study also aims to determine whether criminalising ecocide would lead to the development ofnew justice frameworks, such as environmental courts or tribunals, and contribute to the realisation of SDGs 13, 14,and 15.

          "The discourse in making the corporation liable for ecocide as a crime is supported by case law, international frameworks, and works by jurists in supporting the notion. The study by Polly Higgins (2013) mainly emphasisedthe role of human agency in defining ecocide, with the identification of the entities that can be responsible forecocide. This also goes simultaneously with the theory and study by Vanderhein (2008) on climate justice, whileemphasising that principles such as the polluter pays doctrine must not be in theory, but should be legallyenforceable for better implementation",
          "2.The UK Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of Okpabi v. Royal Dutch Shell (2021) further established that not only the parent company but also its subsidiaries can be held accountable for not adhering to the environmentalstandards. Furthermore, India’s framework for environmental protection also mandates companies to allocate theportion of 2% of their profits to CSR activities, which include environmental safety. (Bhopte, 2024) Theimposition of directorial liability can also be seen in the UK Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act, 2007,which even prosecutes the gross negligence which leads to death. The frameworks and the decision also show that there is a growing recognition of corporate obligations; however, there are lacunae are still there inrecognising it as an offence",
           "Additionally, at the international level, the Rome Statute only penalises environmental destruction during the situation of conflict but does not hold any corporation liable on a general basis. This again raises concern aboutcriminalising ecocide (European Commission n.d.). From the view of Schwegler, we can understand that sanctions alone are not sufficient; a normative shift must be taken.It is aptly said by Verzola (2004) that corporations are driven by the motives of profit, which often leads to thconflict of environmental safety. Hence, it necessitates legal intervention. It was also argued that the concept of strict liability in this context will stifle economic expansion (Jackson)",
           ".In conclusion, this literature reveals a consensus that criminalising ecocide is crucial for dismantling corporate impunity, and the impact will lead to regulations like executive accountability, formulation of legal systems tobridge the gaps between theory and practicality. This research also shows that criminalising ecocide will lead to minimising environmental damage on a large scale at the global level. ",
          "Defined by the International Expert Panel, ecocide is only punished during wartime. Vague legal language like with knowledge allows those who harm the environment to evade their liabilities. Cases like MC Mehta v. Union of India show the important role of activism, but it alone is not sufficient. Legal scholars like Tsilonis call for judicial bodies that specifically address ecocide. Emotional reaction and speeches will not work; actual implementation of laws that punish ecocide is crucial. ",
          "Literature exists among authors and within the law illustrating overwhelming endorsement of the criminalisation of ecocide to provide global justice. Higgins, Short, and South (2013) in their book Protecting the Planet opine that international law should give legal recognition to ecocide to address the responsibility gap left by environmental law. They again state that legal recognition would be symbolic as well as functional in changing cultural patterns with the creation of tools of enforcement. Liao and Pranav (2024) in their paper Ecocide and Accountability: Legal Innovation or Moral Necessity? They further expound on how the law of ecocide can move forward from retributive justice. They contend that the laws should include restoration and prevention as inherent, shifting the way industries approach environmental risk assessment.",
          "Their authors cite that criminal culpability needs to be complemented by wider ESG and sustainability frameworks. The UNEP and PRI (2022) report, ESG, Due Diligence, and Environmental Harm, has condemned the ESG models as unable to stop irreversible damage unless such a risk will have to be attributed to economic or criminal sanctions. The authors' view is that criminalising ecocide will increase the stakes, something that will force companies to have better environmental protection and due diligence. Kysar (2020), Regulating from Nowhere, is a normative thesis and maintains that contemporary legal regimes have to acknowledge obligations to future generations and nonhuman persons. He views ecocide as a crucial middleman between legal rules of legal enforceability and environmental ethics. Ultimately, the Stop Ecocide International Expert Panel Report (2021) demonstrates it is feasible to produce a legally binding definition of ecocide."

Royal Dutch Shell (2021), the Niger Delta Spills examined how the corporations protect themselves from liability. The after-effect of criminalising ecocide will lead to the imposition of civil settlements, liabilities on the executives of the corporations, state actors, and will eventually strengthen the “polluter pays principle.” Holding corporations accountable would lead to the adoption of eco-conscious activities, and additionally, it will also shift the  responsibility to executives, as they are the decision-makers.

          "8.1.Global Blind Spot and Legal Gaps ",
          "Defined by the International Expert Panel (2021) (Legal Definition of Ecocide Drafted by Independent Expert Panel — Stop Ecocide International, n.d.), “Ecocide means unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment.” This section explores how criminalising ecocide can empower judicial activism and trigger NEW judicial mechanisms for environmental justice. Criminalisation prevents greenwashing practices, where companies may appear eco-friendly on the surface while continuing to harm the planet (Minkova,2024). ",
        "Many escape liability for severe environmental harm by citing excuses like We create jobs,It wasn’t intentional,” or We paid fines,” shielding themselves from real consequences—no jail, no fines, no accountability—while the urgent delay in criminalising ecocide threatens both the environment and human life, exposing a global blind spot in ecocide law.",
        "At the international level, the International Criminal Court (ICC) addresses environmental harm only during wartime, but lawyers are advocating to extend jurisdiction to peacetime harm so that destruction by states or corporations no longer goes unpunished, and unlike the other four core international crimes, ecocide still lacks criminal penalties at the ICC (Minkova, 2021), leaving it vulnerable to excuses and legal loopholes.",
        "8.2. When Nature Suffers in Silence, Because It Has No Defender!",
        "Consider the Vietnam War (McElwee, 2020), where Agent Orange and Napalm were used recklessly, leaving Vietnam’s soil, rivers, and forests scarred while nature, though blameless, suffered endlessly, resulting not in victory but in devastation; similarly, in MC Mehta v. Union of India, involving a gas leak in Delhi, the company cited economic harm, but the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India established the principle of absolute liability*—if you run a dangerous industry, you are responsible with no excuses and no exceptions—reflecting a human-centric approach that now must evolve.",
        "This shows that judicial activism alone cannot prevent future harm, as seen in the **Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros case (1997)** where Hungary justified breaking a treaty on environmental grounds—the first time a state used environmental protection as a legal justification—but when the case reached the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the judgment focused on compensation and harm rather than strict accountability, exposing a dangerous silence where ecosystems continue to suffer without legal defence.",
        "As the global environmental crisis deepens, with nature being destroyed on scales beyond the reach of current governance and judicial systems, attorneys and human rights activists are calling for ecocide—the intentional destruction of nature—to be recognised as an international crime.**",
        "8.3 Will criminalising ecocide improve compliance with international environmental agreements?",
        "This chapter examines whether criminalising ecocide can increase adherence to International Environmental Accords (IEAs), arguing that it could enhance compliance with agreements like the Basel Convention, Paris Agreement, and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)** by making state officials personally liable, shaping global norms, and strengthening domestic legal systems; and while challenges remain in jurisdiction, definition clarity, and enforcement, empirical evidence from domestic and regional experiences, along with deterrence and compliance theories, suggests that recognising ecocide as a crime is likely to promote treaty compliance.",
        "Despite the importance of **International Environmental Accords (IEAs) in addressing global issues, state-centric duties, weak enforcement, and soft law mechanisms have led to low compliance (Sands, 2018); the proposal to criminalise ecocide—defined as severe and protracted environmental destruction—\*\*seeks to close this enforcement gap by introducing hard law procedures like those for genocide or war crimes (Higgins et al., 2021), and this chapter explores whether such criminalisation, through its moral implications, domestic implementation, and deterrent effects, can strengthen adherence to IEAs.",
        "8.4. Theoretical Framework: Deterrence and Compliance Theories",
        "According to **deterrence theory** (Nollkaemper, 2011), actors are less likely to engage in harmful behaviour if the legal or reputational costs outweigh the benefits, and compliance theory (Voigt, 2022) suggests that when domestic institutions are compelled to align with international standards, governments are more likely to honour their commitments; thus, criminalising ecocide alters the cost-benefit analysis for governments by imposing both criminal liability on state actors and reputational shame.",
        "8.6.1. Criminal Liability for State Actors",
        "Criminalising ecocide directly targets state authorities and politicians who approve or tolerate large-scale environmental harm, unlike IEAs that impose obligations on governments without individual repercussions, thereby raising the cost of violating environmental commitments through the risk of prosecution in national or international courts (Higgins et al., 2021).",
        "8.6.2. Expressive Function of International Criminal Law",
        "Beyond prosecutions, the expressive power of international criminal law shapes behaviour by signalling that **ecocide, like genocide, is immoral**, and that noncompliance damages reputation (Hamilton, 2025), thereby exerting normative pressure on governments to comply with IEAs even when prosecutions are rare.",
        "8.7. Hard Law Complementing Soft Law",
       " Since most IEAs are voluntary agreements without binding legal force, making ecocide a crime would compel states to adopt stronger environmental standards in domestic law to avoid liability under international criminal law (Sands, 2018); for example, countries that ratified the Paris Agreement could be legally required to enhance their emission reduction strategies, and in terms of political accountability, state leaders and officials who approve ecologically harmful measures in violation of international agreements would risk prosecution (Voigt, 2022).",
        "8.8. European Union (France, Belgium, and Scotland)",
        "The **EU Environmental Crime Directive (2023) makes serious environmental harm a crime to ensure member states comply with international biodiversity and climate obligations (European Commission, 2023), while France and Belgium have already criminalised ecocide under domestic law; similarly, Scotland’s planned ecocide law would hold public servants and decision-makers accountable for major environmental damage, demonstrating how criminalisation can strengthen adherence to international conservation accords (Carrington, 2025).",
      "8.6.1. “A Case Study of The Niger Delta Oil Spills”",
      "8.6.2. Background of The Case:",
      "The Oil River region in Nigeria’s Niger Delta, renowned for palm oil and natural gas production, has suffered severe environmental degradation from decades of exploitative oil exploration and extraction, with its vital ecosystems—mangroves and wetlands, essential for terrestrial and marine biodiversity—devastated by repeated oil spills and negligent practices.",
      "To add insult to injury, the socio-economic conditions of the region, like poverty and corrupt government systems,only hinder the efforts made to address these issues.",
      "8.6.3. Analysis Of Its Impact",
      "The figures (quantity) of the crude oil spilt in the region are inconsistent, but the pervasive belief is that an estimated 13 million barrels (1.5 million tons) of crude oil have been spilt since 1958 from over 7,000 oil spill incidents, resulting in a yearly average of about 240,000 barrels (Brisibe, 2013).",
      "The inconsistency in acquiring the exact quantifiable data of the crude oil spilled is attributed to several factors, like certain spill sites being inaccessible due to swampy conditions, and/or security concerns; remoteness, with spills occurring away from community locations; delayed detection of the incident; the high volatility of the Nigerian crude oil, causing an estimated 50% to evaporate within 24 to 48 hours; under-reporting by the culpable company; and governmental oversight (Steiner, 2010). The impact of such unchecked oil spills spanning decades results in long-term effects, such as chronic health issues and degradation of ecological systems. By quantifying the effect, researchers can better assess the severity of the issue and identify areas for inspection and intervention.",
      "8.6.4. Stakeholder Analysis:",
      "The analysis would primarily encourage stakeholders to maintain a collaborative and communicative relationship—for example, while an oil company implements a rapid response to spills, government agencies can manage regulatory oversight and law enforcement, reducing conflict and miscommunication. This approach promotes accountability among oil companies, while also motivating government agencies and local communities to participate in early detection and investigation of spills. Additionally, government systems must address emerging climate concerns by fulfilling their duties and ensuring strict enforcement of laws. It is imperative that oil companies maintain transparency, uphold accountability, and prioritise safety whether or not these laws are actively enforced.",
      "8.9. Challenges and Limitations",
      "Despite its potential, several obstacles could limit the effectiveness of ecocide prosecution:",
      "1. Limited Jurisdiction – Major polluters may choose not to ratify ecocide under the Rome Statute (Voigt, 2022).",
       "2. Definition Clarity – Overly broad or narrow definitions could result in political misuse or under-enforcement (Higgins et al., 2021).",
      "3. Enforcement Capacity – Many states lack the judicial and investigative resources needed to prosecute ecocide (UNEP, 2019).",
       "8.7.1. Norm Creation and Peer Pressure",
       "Just as genocide laws strengthened standards against mass crimes, criminalising ecocide establishes a worldwide environmental standard. States that pass ecocide laws might face diplomatic and reputational pressure to demonstrate that they are upholding their international environmental obligations (Hamilton, 2025).",
       "8.8.1 From Profit to Prosecution: Defining Corporate Responsibility",
       "Examining the implications of criminalising ecocide within the scope of corporate accountability involves human agency, an aspect that Higgins incorporates into the definition. The inclusion of the term 'human agency' signifies the identification of individuals or entities that may be held responsible or accountable for committing ecocide (Polly Higgins, 2013). Jurisprudence emphasises that corporate liability frequently depends on demonstrable knowledge of risks and a failure to act prudently. Even though there are several cases which support corporate liability for environmental damages on a mass scale, such as **Okpabi v. Royal Dutch Shell (2021)**. In this case, the UK Supreme Court resolved an important complication of holding legal responsibility of the parent company in cases of environmental destruction caused by the affiliates. The above issue was regarding the alleged oil spills, and according to the company’s policy, RDS was responsible for several activities, such as health, environmental standards. The court held that the company had the responsibility to take care based on its management of activities (Gosain, 2025). Criminalising ecocide would fundamentally shift the burden of proof onto corporations, compelling them to disprove negligence or to justify their actions under principles such as the “polluter pays” doctrine. Therefore, while strict liability may streamline prosecution efforts, existing legal frameworks already encompass corporate accountability through systems that focus on prosecution. For example, on the national level, India has made a framework, which is the **Environment Protection Act, 1986**, which imposes corporate liability to prevent environmental pollution. Moreover, the **Companies Act, 2013**, has also included the importance of responsibility towards environmental safety through CSR activities. It requires every company to spend 2% of its net profit on CSR activities (Nitesh Bhopte, 2024). In the UK, the **Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007** holds companies liable for wilful neglect that amounts to death (Edwards). It is worth noting that on the international level, for instance, the European Union made corporations liable for any environmental damage through the polluter pays principle and intergenerational equity (Commission, n.d.). Similarly, on the international level, **Article 8(2)(b)(iv) of the Rome Statute** deals with the penalising of intentionally launching an attack which is already in the knowledge that that attack will cause incidental loss of life, civilians, and the environment. If ecocide is criminalised, then the Provisions related to corporate liability in terms of ecocide can be incorporated. Without a shadow of a doubt, corporations face complications in defining parameters because they capitalise on commodity production: the more they produce, the higher their profits (Verzola, 2004-6-2). Significant progress has been made in developing tools for assigning responsibility and reparation in environmental crime cases. As Vanderheiden aptly notes, an effective and efficient international climate change regime must be based on **responsibility and compensation** (Polly Higgins, 2013). However, this principle remains hollow unless corporations are made legally accountable for ecological destruction. Implementation would automatically impose responsibilities on corporations, preventing them from escaping liability by pleading ignorance in court. Criminalising ecocide would also enable the prosecution of individual executives directly, rather than merely piercing the corporate veil, as illustrated by the **Bhopal Gas Tragedy** (Ipe, 2005). Furthermore, it would foster the establishment of normative standards alongside sanctions, since the effectiveness of sanctions alone is not sufficient (Schwegler, 2017). ",
     "8.8.2. Individual Accountability",
     "When considering corporate accountability and framing ecocide as a corporate crime, it should be treated as a collective offence, since company decisions are directed by CEOs and involve shareholders, board members, directors, and other executives. A major problem is that companies often evade liability by claiming ignorance, leaving the individuals who direct company actions unaccountable, partly to avoid negative publicity that could erode trust among citizens and investors (Jackson; Jackson). Criminalising ecocide would create a pathway for both corporate and individual accountability, navigating challenges such as establishing mens rea or, where absent, demonstrating actus reus in the harm caused by the company. It is time to translate theoretical frameworks into practice, moving from traditional interpretations to advanced applications. International criminalisation of ecocide could serve as an effective tool, potentially dismantling corporate impunity and negligence.",
     "8.9. Judicial Activism: Potential and Critique",
     "Legal recognition of ecocide could empower courts where traditional law remains silent; however, judicial activism faces critiques—overreach, confusion, and threats to democratic balance—and differing judicial views often result in inconsistent regulation and unclear policy outcomes (Singh, 2024). Clarity is therefore essential, especially in defining ecocide, as vague terms like “with knowledge” create legal gaps allowing entities to cause long-term harm while claiming ignorance (Palarczyk, 2023). The **MC Mehta v. Union of India** case shows that activism can play a crucial role when companies use excuses like job creation or lack of intent to evade responsibility. Yet courts alone cannot address all issues; dedicated judicial mechanisms, specialised institutions, and precise laws are needed. Criminalisation could serve as the crucial link between activism and the establishment of these new institutions—YES!",
     "8.9.1. From Activism to Institutional Mechanisms",
     "Tsilonis argues that the ICC’s limited jurisdiction cannot fully protect nature, suggesting that a separate international judicial body with autonomy and ecological expertise may be necessary (Tsilonis, 2024). The groundwork is already in place (Gairdner, 2025):",

"National Green Tribunal (NGT) represents a step toward environmental accountability but suffers from limited jurisdiction, backlog delays, and weak implementation (Bajpai & Shagun, 2025). If ecocide is criminalised, India must either expand the NGT’s mandate to include criminal powers or establish specialised environmental courts within the criminal justice system. Without structural reform, judicial power remains symbolic, and without precise laws, even new judicial bodies will lack enforcement strength. As stated in the report “Be Reflective, Be Normative” (Minkova, 2024), legal rules should not be followed blindly—what was valid yesterday may not be valid today.",

Criminalisation involves the imposition of real and legal consequences, from which no one can escape. Ecocide has the potential to reverse this trend. It is not solely about punishment; it also concerns justice for indigenous groups, fishing villages, and farming families. It is high time to recognise that Earth is not about conducting bad business; it is about preventing crimes against both the future and the present. Criminalising ecocide could play a vital role in protecting the environment, strengthening legal enforcement, and upholding sustainable development goals. The path forward will not be easy; resistance from vested interests is inevitable. However, as species vanish and wildfires intensify, criminalising ecocide is not radical but a crucial step. As the paper demonstrated, criminalisation can have a positive impact on several aspects, including environmental justice, holding states accountable, regulating corporations, and enabling the judiciary to contribute effectivel"

      "India's vibrant platform economy from ride-sharing and food delivery to online freelancing and local services, has provided jobs for more than 7.7 million workers (ILO, 2021). This paper in detail assesses the intersection of Gender and Gig economy focussing on the unique issues that women face in working in Gig economy.",
      "Women and transgender gig workers in India face systemic exclusion from essential labor protections, including access to health insurance, maternity benefits, minimum wage guarantees, and grievance redressal mechanisms. This marginalization is further intensified by Algorithmic biases and the precarious nature of gig work, leading to heightened job insecurity and exploitation (Fairwork India, 2023).",
      "India's recent labor law revamp brought in four combined labor codes aimed at simplifying protections and enhance compliance. However, their applicability and relevance to gig and platform workers are unclear. This paper also critically assesses the inadequacies of India's labour codes revamped including Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020) for women Gig workers.",
      "By analyzing existing policy gaps and exploring gender-sensitive approaches to social protection, the research aims to inform inclusive legal, economic and gender sensitive infrastructural strategies that safeguard women gig workers’ social security rights, enhance their economic agency, and ensure equitable participation in India’s evolving digital labor market."

    intro: [
      "The gig economy in India is transforming how people work. An increasing number of Indians are now making money through short-term, task-based work organized through digital platforms rather than the conventional 9–5 job. In India's cities and towns, gig work has become a normal aspect of daily life, whether it be food delivery, ridesharing, appliance repair, freelance design, or online writing.",
      "There are currently about 12 million gig workers in India, according to recent data. According to NITI Aayog, that figure is anticipated to almost double to 23.5 million by 2030. Platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, Uber, Ola, and Urban Company have become household names. Meanwhile, freelance marketplaces like Upwork and Fiverr have given skilled Indian workers access to international markets.",
      "What is causing this expansion? There are several important causes. First, a large portion of India's youthful and urban population favors flexible work arrangements. Second, smartphones and mobile internet are now available to nearly everyone. Third, people can now get paid instantly more easily thanks to the growth of digital payment methods like UPI. Another major factor was the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced more people and services online and increased demand for remote gig work and delivery.",
      "However, things are not always easy. The majority of gig workers are not regarded as formal employees. Since they are referred to as 'independent contractors,' they are not eligible for job security, paid time off, health benefits, or insurance. Depending on demand, ratings, or modifications to the app's guidelines, their revenue may fluctuate daily. Additionally, workers frequently have little control or transparency over how they are treated because most platforms use algorithms to determine who gets which jobs.",
      "Nevertheless, the gig economy is growing in importance within India's overall economy. According to a Boston Consulting Group report from 2021, this industry has the potential to generate tens of millions of jobs and up to 1.25 percent of India's GDP in the future — particularly for those who don't follow traditional career paths. Additionally, it facilitates people's entry into the digital economy by providing them with their first access to bank accounts, identification systems, and occasionally even credit.",
      "Briefly put, the gig economy in India is expanding quickly. It opens up new possibilities, particularly for those who are excluded from formal employment or desire flexibility. However, it also brings up important issues regarding equity, job security, and the nature of work in the future. This section provides an overview of the current situation and lays the groundwork for the subsequent chapters' in-depth examination of gender issues, protections, and policy challenges."

        heading: "Gender Participation in India’s Gig Economy",
        paragraphs: [
          "The digital gig economy in India, though promoted for ease of convenience and autonomy, still exhibits deep-seated gender inequalities. Women are still significantly underrepresented, research indicates a low 16–23 % contribution with a high concentration of females in beauty, care, and domestic work, while transport and delivery sectors are dominated by men (Panda, 2023; Nandkumar & Sharma et al., 2025). This occupational differentiation is a repeat of deep-rooted patriarchal values and low mobility for females (Ghosh, Zaidi, & Ramachandran, 2022).",
          "The empirical evidence indicates both opportunity as well as precariousness. IDinsight’s survey of drivers of platforms in India found that while women value gig work for its flexibility, they are exposed to high safety risks, digital exclusion, as well as discrimination (Panwar, Singh, & Chaudhary, 2024). In addition, Sharma (2023) indicates a deficiency of formal protection; women gig workers are denied benefits of paid leave, maternity cover, as well as judicial remedies, thus exposing them further to harassment as well as volatility of income.",
          "Algorithmic regulation of digital platforms generates a further element of inequality. Women have stricter performance demands with fewer hours worked, resulting in sanctions, account-blocking, and capped pay (Ghosh & Talukdar, 2025; Kasliwal, 2020). Ghosh et al. (2022) go on to illustrate that hybrid contractual arrangements of beauty compared to ride-hailing platforms generate outcomes in tension, while workers on beauty platforms have agency, they still have low pay with restricted mobility.",
          "The structural and socio-legal environment makes a difference too: in spite of India’s e-Shram portal for informal and gig workers, digital accessibility barriers remain, constraining registration of females as well as their benefits (Hasin, 2025). A more expansive synthesis of 23 worldwide studies verifies enduring gender pay gaps, algorithmic discrimination, as well as safety issues in gig platforms (Bhagavathi & Kumar, 2025). For inclusive growth, platforms and policymakers should invest in gender-sensitive design, robust grievance mechanisms, and binding labour protections. If done in that way, the gig economy can realize its potential for enabling women's economic empowerment in India."

        paragraphs: [
          "India's platform economy is growing steadily, transforming access to and organization of work. From food delivery and ride sharing to freelancing and home services, over 7.7 million workers are currently employed through digital platforms (ILO, 2021). Although such employment is flexible, it is largely informal, insecure, and non-transparent. Gig workers are not entitled to essential benefits like health insurance, maternity leave, minimum wages, and formal grievance redressal.",
          "The recent labour law amendments in India have established four integrated codes: the Code on Wages, the Industrial Relations Code, the Code on Social Security, and the Occupational Safety and Working Conditions Code. These seek to streamline labour protection but their reach to gig workers is not yet certain. The Code on Wages establishes payment and wage standards but does not clarify how these are applicable to platform workers whose remuneration is determined by algorithms and customer scores (Rawal and Deshpande, 2022). The Industrial Relations Code facilitates collective bargaining but keeps gig workers outside the purview of formal recognition, excluding them from union rights (ILO, 2021).",
          "The Code on Social Security is the only legislation that defines gig workers and requires welfare schemes, but enforcement has been lacking. The Safety Code targets conventional workplaces and does not provide any protection to gig workers in unregulated settings.",
          "In addition to legal obscurity, platform workers suffer from institutional invisibility. Platforms cross borders, undermining enforcement. Workers are assessed by inscrutable algorithmic systems that can reduce pay or terminate them without cause. Women and minority groups are at greater risk of including unsafe workplaces and biased feedback mechanisms. Being absent formal legal identity and transparent redressal opportunities, gig workers have no actual means to dispute unjust treatment or hazardous conditions.",
          "Several Indian states have taken steps forward: Karnataka’s 2025 Ordinance mandates a welfare board and cess contributions, while Rajasthan's 2023 Act established a gig worker registry and welfare fund. International models offer additional insights. Spain classifies gig workers as employees with full rights, Germany allows unionization, Brazil has labour courts for gig conflicts and China regulates platform algorithms to ensure transparency.",
          "Without inclusive protections, India’s digital economy risks reinforcing inequality. Recognizing gig work as legitimate work is essential to ensuring justice in the digital age. For India to build a just and equitable digital future, gig workers must be recognised not as peripheral actors, but as central to the new economy. This recognition must be backed by enforceable legal rights, institutional mechanisms, and political will.",

        heading: "Choice or Necessity? Understanding Motivation Behind Gig Work for Women in India",
        paragraphs: [
          "The narrative of the gig economy is flexible and empowering, but the women entering the field speak a different story. If a woman is single and business-minded, with adequate knowledge of digital platforms, then being a part of the gig economy is a blessing, as they actually get space to enhance their business. But married women often face societal norms, restricting them to work on these platforms, as they are either under the surveillance of their husband and in-laws, or they do not have adequate digital literacy. So, around the pandemic in 2020, when men lost their jobs and both the partners needed to work to get a minimum income, women’s participation was around 28%, but it dropped by 6.9% (ISB) in 2021.",
          "Most of the women enter this space not from freedom, but from constraint. The constraints are structural in nature, highlighting limited job availability, rigid working hours, and gendered care-giving responsibilities. All these factors push women to work in the informal gig economy, where they are often exploited. The reason why women prefer working in the informal sector is because the formal labour market continues to fail them: India’s female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) stood at just 25.4% in 2021–22 (Periodic Labour Force Survey), among the lowest globally.",
          "In the above case, the gig economy becomes the only viable option for them. The NITI Aayog report, published in 2022, estimates that women constitute around 20% of India’s gig workforce. There is a heavy reliance on beauty, domestic care, and digital micro-tasking industries. Many of these roles, especially on platforms like Urban Company or Amazon Mechanical Turk, are marketed as “flexible.” Flexibility was considered to be a blessing until it started masking a lack of labour protections, income instability, and algorithmic control that leaves women with little bargaining power.",
          "Soon, it burdened women, turning the blessing into a curse. According to a 2021 ILO–Asian Development Bank study, 47% of Indian women who lost formal employment during COVID did not return to traditional work. Many of them turned to gig platforms out of necessity. The lack of childcare and the informal nature of the job made it impossible for the women to re-enter the formal job market.",
          "Even when we see that women are employed, the decision is often shaped by the limited alternatives they have. Research conducted by IWWAGE (2023) shows that gig-working women in India often work fewer hours, earn less than men, and face safety and mobility concerns that affect work availability.",
          "It’s true that women do experience autonomy in such work platforms; the broader trend reflects a survival strategy. They are trying to adapt to an economy, but society still fails to provide them with security and gender-equal employment."

        paragraphs: [
          "The gig economy in India, powered by the digital infrastructure of Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, and Urban Company, has redefined the dynamics of work in India by focusing on three factors: flexibility, autonomy, and convenience. Nonetheless, this quick development has also resulted in this major disengagement of classic labor protections. In comparison to traditional employment models that provide social security, stable wages, and regulation, gig work is poorly characterized by casual settings, lack of job security factors, and limited regulation.",
          "Platform-based workers are usually categorized as independent contractors as opposed to being treated as employees, thereby absolving the companies of the responsibility of covering provincial fund, health benefit, paid leaves, or any compensation in the case of injury in the working environment.",
          "Consequently, gigworkers cannot be covered by the Indian labor laws including the Industrial Disputes Actor the Employees State Insurance Act even though their work experiences significantly contribute to the digital economy. This factor increases the vulnerability of the workers particularly when a crisis hits. In addition, digital platforms promote both opaque employments and variable pay, as well as pressure to maintain high performances, all attributable to algorithmic management.",
          "Although the government of India enacted the Code on Social Security, 2020 to acknowledge the social security of gig and platform workers, its effectiveness has been unclear, and enforcement powers have been limited. The policy interventions to redefine the employment classifications, provide minimum wages as well as social security nets to the gig workers are imperative at the present moment.",
          "Although it can be seen that the gig economy is beneficial in terms of innovation and job creation, it is also headed toward serious ethical and socioeconomic issues related to its absence of traditional labor protection. To make sure that the inclusion of growth in the Indian digital labor force is achieved, a redesigned model where flexibility goes hand in hand with fairness, and expansion with honor to all laborers, is going to be required."

          "When workers are hired on a short term basis with flexible hours to work, they are considered Gig workers. Due to digitalization and rapid economic growth, gig workers are increasingly hired, but often excluded from formal employee benefits. There is a short term contract between employer and employee, but they lack a formal structure of benefits for workers and assign with disparities for women employees.",
          "Around the world, women perform two-thirds of the work for 10 percent of the income and only 1 percent of the assets. This shows a wider gap in society where gender disparity is at its peak, women often found in household tasks and due to growing challenges of the economy the gender gap is increasing where social protection is highly accepted but less found. There is a high chance of increasing discrimination specially for gender specific traditional work due to lack of job security and uncertain employment status.",
          "Social protection is required for any worker who is contributing to the economy but in society there is a huge gender gap which eliminates women and LGBTQ+ out of work due to rising challenges. Workers hired to fulfill short term goals and lack in social benefits especially human rights and fundamental rights not followed in meeting short term goals.",

          "Policy legislation should establish a statutory definition of “living wage” as the minimum income needed to afford necessities, including digital access, in a worker’s municipality or Urban Local Body (ULB). For determining a real-time fair living wage system, an Al-driven Living Wage Tool (LWT) should be deployed to calculate area-specific, job-role-based living wages, updated periodically by integrating data from the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), and National Family Health Survey (NFHS), and linked with gig platform APIs to auto-suggest standard fair per task payments.",
          "State-level Living Wage Commissions should be established with the respective Ministries of Labour and Employment to localize wage standards using predictive models integrating datasets from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), and urban bodies. Platforms must be mandated to disclose baseline pay benchmarks derived from the LWT. In the initial phase, a standard living wage should be enforced, ensuring no task is paid below the regionally indexed standard. Furthermore, algorithmic transparency should be guaranteed, including access to methodology and regular participatory revision with stakeholders.",
          "The Government of India should develop a centralized National Living Wage Data Stack (NLWDS) with Aadhaar-linked payment tracking and real-time benchmarks to ensure women gig workers receive legally mandated wages. Establishing a Social Security Data Trust (SSDT) can streamline data sharing across platforms and public systems, enabling targeted delivery of wages and benefits. This is inspired by the European Union Platform Work Directive (De Stefano, 2016). Additionally, a statute-backed Ombudsman Authority should be created through an amendment to the Code of Wages, 2019, to handle grievances and ensure compliance.",
          "To further support social protection for women gig workers, the government should establish “Platform Sakhi” – women-led digital platform cooperatives. This would require amending the Model Cooperative Societies Act to formally recognize digital platform cooperatives. These cooperatives, governed by women, would digitally register service workers, facilitate job-matching, and integrate with the e-Shram portal for access to health and life insurance. They would also manage monthly social security contributions and simplify bureaucratic compliance for employers, acting as a single-window access point for government welfare schemes, training, and maternity benefits. This model draws inspiration from Argentina’s domestic worker platform cooperative, which combines worker ownership with backend formalization and benefit delivery (Filipetto, Micha, Pereyra, Poggi, & Trombetta, 2023).",
          "The Unorganised Workers Social Security Act (2008) must be amended to explicitly include platform-based gig workers, ensuring access to national welfare schemes (Rani & Furrer, 2016). A mandated 1% Platform Worker Cess on aggregator platform revenue, as introduced in the Karnataka Platform-Based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Ordinance (2025), can create a pooled fund dedicated to gig workers’ social security. This would be similar to the Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Cess Act (1996). Furthermore, the introduction of Universal Portable Benefit Accounts (UPBA), linked to Addhaar and e-Shram, can ensure portability and continuity of benefits across platforms and states (Rosenblat, 2018).",
          "State governments and Urban Local Bodies must invest in gender-sensitive infrastructure, especially rest zones every 5–8 km in cities with clean restrooms for men and women, as seen in the Greater Chennai Corporation pilot rest centres. Such infrastructure would significantly boost workplace participation and retention (Beria & Kabeer, 2020)."

    conclusion:[
      "India’s digital economy faces a crucial challenge with a growing workforce and unregulated digital platforms. Women and transgender individuals are especially vulnerable to digital and algorithmic bias, along with structural societal issues. This necessitates converging and gender-sensitive policy interventions for a more inclusive digital economy.",
      "Policy frameworks must be developed through multi-level and multi-stakeholder participation, with regular revisions and robust compliance mechanisms. In addition to government intervention, platforms must proactively ensure safe online spaces and prevent digital and physical abuse of women and transgender gig workers. Programs like *Mahila Samarthya Yojana* should be aligned with modern technological needs for long-term sustainability. In the short run, platforms may be incentivized for implementing work-friendly policies through tax rebates and exemptions.",
      "Ultimately, social protection is not an optional luxury—it is a constitutional right under Article 21. Legal reforms and structural changes must ensure a greater participation of women in the workforce, addressing core technological inequities. The gig economy holds significant potential for empowering women and ensuring equitable workforce participation in India's journey towards becoming a developed nation by 2047."

  abstract: [
    "This paper is a critical analysis of India’s evolving maritime strategy in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) from 2008 to 2024, putting forth the argument of India’s‘blue diplomacy’witnessing a strategic paradigm shift that now transcends the confines of the Indo-Pacific narrative to adopt a much more feasible approach. Laid down in the SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) vision and refined under the recent MAHASAGAR framework, India’s policies in the WIO interpret maritime security, regional connectivity, ecological supervision, and sustainable development as interlinked pillars of foreign policy. The study explores how the pressing necessity of safeguarding vital sea lanes that handle over 80% of India’s crude oil imports and a significant share of national trade, drives forward India’s westward focus of deep engagement with the geopolitically sensitive WIO region.",
    "Key aspects of this‘blue diplomacy’include strong maritime security collaboration against common threats like piracy, arms proliferation, and illicit trafficking, enabled by operations such as Operation Sankalp and through initiatives like the Information Fusion Centre–Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR). The paper investigates the strategic use of port development by India and highlights projects like Chabahar in Iran and Sittwe in Myanmar, serving both as hubs for logistics as well as tools for encouraging inclusive regional development, improving access particularly for landlocked economies and strengthening India’s“Act East” and “Neighbourhood First” policies.",
    "The research also digs around India’s active involvement with international platforms such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) to support the growth of the sustainable ocean-based economy and improve cooperation. Additionally, the study makes a point of aligning the Sustainable Development Goals (particularly SDGs 13, 14, 16, and 17) into India’s maritime plan.",

  intro: [
    "The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) has become an important strategic marine arena in the 21st century. The area is very important for the safety, economy, and environment of the larger Indo-Pacific because it is close to important sea lanes of communication (SLOCs) that help transfer a lot of the world’s products and energy. India needs to protect its national interests not just at the WIO, which is a marine border. It’s also a way to show strength through strategic partnerships, port diplomacyand efforts to promote long-term growth. ",
    "India’s part in the WIO has changed in the last few years. It used to be largely about safety, but today it works together in many ways. There are also investments in ports like Chabahar and Sittwe, as well as donations to entities like the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC). In addition to this, there are also anti-piracy operations, humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HADR) missions, and efforts to make the navy stronger. India’s focus on protecting marine biodiversity, making the climate more resilient, and blue economy projects is another indicator that it is in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",
    "A number of scholars are still interested in India’s involvement in the WIO, but most of their work has focused on what it does in the Eastern Indo-Pacific. This article tries to fill in the gaps by looking at how India’s strategic shift towards the WIO affects long-term maritime governance and regional security, as well as the geopolitical effects of its port diplomacy.The study’s goal is to employ theme analysis to show how India’s changing maritime position could affect the future of the Western Indian Ocean system in its entirety.",

     heading: "PROBLEM STATEMENT",
      paragraphs: ["Despite India’s continued involvement in the Indo-Pacific, the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) has not gotten much attention in talks of strategic maritime research and policy. Given the rise of maritime issues like illicit fishing, environmental effect, piracy, and geopolitical competition, particularly with China, India’s admission to the WIO under the SAGAR and later MAHASAGAR doctrines marks a significant change. There is a significant research gap in evaluating how India integrates sustainability, security, and diplomacy to become a net security provider in this vital region."

        "India’s strategic approach to the Western Indian Ocean since 2008 put forward a calibrated modification of the sovereign state’s maritime vision that moved away from the entire Indo-Pacific framework to a specific and much more feasible narrative of fusing its economic ambitions, security needs and sustainability in accordance with international law. This thematic section delves into the critical aspects of India’s ever-evolving maritime approach in the WIO and its strategic adaptation beyond the Indo-Pacific corridors ever since the inception of the SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) doctrine, its special focus on sovereignty under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and its systematic alignment with the UN-laid Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDGs 14, 8, and 16. These focus points allow the strengthening of India’s leadership in the region, intersecting broader concepts such as security cooperation, infrastructural support, global partnerships, and ecological responsibility. Through this unified, interlinked and interdependent structure, India continues to push for its claim as the regional advocate for legitimacy, partnership and responsible guardianship across the WIO."

       heading: "Strategic shift beyond the Indo-Pacific",

        "India’s paradigm shift from a historical focus on the Indo-Pacific corridors towards the Western Indian Ocean is driven by the ever-growing dependence on sea lanes that make up for over 80% of the overall crude oil imports and large volumes of trade (Haldar & Gupta, 2025). The rise of maritime threats including piracy, trafficking, and strategic rivalry compelled India to turn its focus westward. This strategic shift is further reinforced by the WIO’s proximity to the Middle Eastern countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, which collectively make up 40% to over 50% of India’s total crude oil imports (Haldar & Gupta, 2025).",
        "This strategy was consolidated by the SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) doctrine which was announced in 2015 and prioritized: Oceans’ security through the enhancement of cooperation and naval monitoring. Secondly, inclusive regional growth fostering economic partnerships with coastal and island states in the WIO. Thirdly, nurturing regional stability through diplomatic coalitions (Kesnur and Mishra, 2022; Naha, 2021).",
        "The SAGAR doctrine has undergone significant evolution and was rearticulated in March 2025 as, Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions (MAHASAGAR). This strategic shift solidifies India’s role as a regional balance maker and net security provider capable of capacity building, military diplomacy, military assistance and direct deployment of its own military forces, thus contributing to regional resilience and sustainability while also safeguarding shared maritime commons (Haldar & Gupta, 2025; E-IR, 2025)."

        "India’s blue economy framework is a detailed and all-encompassing plan which integrates economic growth and ecosystem conservation (TERI, 2022). This strategy is defined through a holistic understanding of the Blue Economy Vision, a vital component of the much bigger Vision of New India by 2030 (Press Information Bureau [PIB], 2022). The vision aims for national development by making effective and responsible use of the ocean resources, while the strategy focuses on sustainable use of resources in sectors such as fisheries, tourism, maritime transport, renewable energy, aquaculture, seabed mining, and marine biotechnology, across offshore and coastal lines (Ministry of Earth Sciences, 2025; TERI, 2022; KPMG, 2024).

A Maritime Strategy can be defined as the principle that governs a war at sea. It has become one of the topmost priorities of India’s foreign policies since the Mumbai attacks in 2008 which arose from the maritime border. 2008 stands as a year that marks a strategic shift of maritime strategies that addresses security challenges from diverse sources like antagonistic neighbours to non-state actors like pirates, maritime terrorists and armed robbers.",

The re-emergence of piracy invasions along the coast of Somalia between 2007-2012 became a major factor in continuous deployment of the Indian Navy to escort vulnerable commercial vessels to safety. This scenario is what prompted the launching of Operation Sankalp in 2019, thus India’s response to the growing tension in the Gulf. It provided protection for Indian-flagged merchant ships overflying maritime zones in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and the Middle East. Another component of India’s approach involves starting construction of an airstrip and jetty on Agalega Island in Mauritius in 2024. With regional partnerships being of utmost importance in times of invasions, there have been several examples where coordinated multilateral responses have resulted in timely rescue. Indian Navy navy together with Seychelles Defence Forces and Sri Lanka Navy intercepted and rescued hijacked vessel on 27 January 2024. India and Madagascar have expanded their naval and defence relations through arrangements that help each other to fight piracy, illegal fishing, and other such crimes targeted against maritime security.

The dissolved CO2 reacts with the seawater to form carbonic acid and lowers the ocean’s pH in the process also known as ocean acidification, which further results in the weakening of coral skeletons and dissolving of the shells of molluscs and planktons, but also disrupting the lives of billions of people who ultimately depend upon the oceans for their nutrition and livelihoods. In fact, it is projected to decrease the ocean’s pH levels from approximately 8.1 to 7.7 by the end of the century, the consequences to which would be nothing short of detrimental.

        "This crisis is particularly alarming in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), a region of exceptional biodiversity and immense economic importance. From Seychelles’ coral reefs to Madagascar’s dense mangrove forests and seagrass meadows that line the coasts of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique, the WIO is home to over 11,000 documented species. Yet, decades of overexploitation and habitat loss have placed these ecosystems under tremendous pressure. Mangrove cover is shrinking, Kenya and Tanzania have lost about 18% in the past 25 years, while Mozambique has lost 27% in an even shorter period. Coral reefs have declined by 15% following major bleaching events such as the 1997-98 El Niño. The region’s busy shipping lanes, which carry a third of global oil tanker traffic, further expose it to the risk of oil spills and invasive species. The collapse of these habitats may have catastrophic effects as fewer nursery grounds for fish would mean dwindling fish stocks and reduced food security for millions.

It gives a big picture of the sea that encompasses safety, connections, growth, and working together in the area. India’s SAGAR strategy asks for a long-term and broad commitment in the area, which includes enhanced military presence and marine domain awareness, humanitarian help, and building capacity. India backs a rules-based and international system through entities like IORA, BIMSTEC, and regional free trade agreements.",
    "India’s strategic investments in regions like Chabahar and Sittwe only make it simpler to trade and get about, but they also show that India is a good partner for security and progress. India does this to stop relying too much on important trade routes like Malacca and to stop China from being stronger. Building infrastructure that can handle climate change, doing health diplomacy, and teaching people in Africa are all ways that India is helping South–South solidarity.",
    "India visualizes itself as a bridge between the Indo-Pacific and the Western Indian Ocean. India’s concept of the maritime commons isn’t military but it’s broad and includes a realistic view of geopolitics and a dedication to development. It wants to create a safe, open marine system that protects the common good for everyone while also keeping its own strategic independence."

  abstract: [
   "This study is to critically examine how targeted digital education policies and initiatives have contributed to reducing educational inequality in India. By using key policies such as the BharatNet Project, PM e-vidya, DIKSHA platform as evaluative tools, this study aims to assess both their achievements in improving access, inclusion, and learning outcomes, and their limitations in addressing structural and digital disparities across socio-economic, rural-urban, and gender divides.",
   "We used the descriptive method by reviewing policies, government reports, news articles, and educational data from official sources to understand how digital initiatives are addressing educational inequalities in India.",
   "Digital policies like BharatNet and Digital India have improved internet access in rural areas, and have helped schools adopt online learning. However, gaps still remain due to lack of devices, electricity, and digital skills, and access to the internet in some regions.",
   "Further, the study seeks to bridge the gap between policy intent and on-ground impact, enhanced understanding of how far these digital interventions have progressed in transforming educational equity, and what barriers persist in the path toward inclusive and equitable quality education. The study relies on secondary data sources and does not include direct surveys or interviews, so some ground-level issues may not be fully recorded."

  intro: [
   "Educational inequality remains a persistent challenge in India, deeply rooted in historical, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities. Despite significant progress in enrollment rates and infrastructure development over the past decades, access to quality education continues to be uneven, particularly across rural-urban divides, income groups, and gender. In response to these disparities, to address these gaps, digital technology is now being seen as an important way to make education more equal and accessible for everyone.",
   "In alignment with the global commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) which seeks to reduce inequality, India has taken several policy initiatives aimed at leveraging digital infrastructure to enhance educational access and equity. Key among these are the Digital India Campaign, PM e-Vidya, the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and the DIKSHA platform. These initiatives together show a change in policy, focusing on using technology-based solutions that can reach many people, with the goal of reducing gaps in access to and involvement in education.",
   "However, the transformative potential of digital education remains contested, especially in the context of pre-existing structural inequalities. While digital platforms have expanded the reach of educational content, they have also exposed and, in some cases, deepened the digital divide, particularly among economically marginalized populations, rural communities, and genderdisadvantaged groups. The accessibility, usability, and effectiveness of these digital interventions vary widely across different socio-economic contexts, raising important questions about their actual impact on educational equity.",
   "This study seeks to critically examine the extent to which these targeted digital education policies have contributed to reducing educational inequality in India. By evaluating the achievements and limitations of these initiatives, the research aims to bridge the gap between policy formulation and ground-level implementation. In doing so, it endeavors to offer a nuanced understanding of the role of digital interventions in advancing equitable and inclusive education, and to identify the systemic barriers that continue to impede progress."

    heading: "THEME 1: Project BharatNet : It’s impact on reducing Digital divide in educational sectors of rural India",
    paragraphs: [
     "The government is trying to reduce education inequality through many initiatives like online open learning, free e-library access, skill development platforms like NPTEL, SWAM etc. but it can’t be possible without proper internet connection. Reddy,Jose&Vaidehi (2021)argue that Massive online education without addressing the huge access gap and disparities in digital infrastructure would not only exclude a vast majority of students but also exacerbate the existing socio‑economic disparities in educational opportunities.",
     "Basic Introduction of BharatNet;-",
     "BharaNet is one of the impactful projects among all initiatives of the GOV, those are taken for reducing educational disparities among the different regions of the country. Actually, under this initiative the Govt is trying to give broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country as well as It is one of the biggest rural telecom projects in the world. [PressInformation Bureau (2025)]",
     "Brief about its implementation:-",
     "The BharatNet project was initially approved in October 2011 as the National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) to connect 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats [USOF,DoT,MinistryofCommunications,GOI (2025)] after in 2015 it was renamed as BharatNet [BusinessStandard(2015)]. However, significant delays led the Union Cabinet in July 2017 to approve a modified strategy for its implementation, rebranding the project as BharatNet and initiating Phase II with state and private partnerships [IndiaToday (2017)].",
     "It plays a major role particularly in some states of India to spread internet access in the Gram Panchayats though there are some controversies related to its achievement and proper impact. As per the report of the Press Information Bureau (2025) of 19 March 2025, 218,347 Gram Panchayats have been made service ready under the project which is not so far from its initial objective to connect approx 2.5 lakh Gram Panchyats with internet connection. [PressInformationBureau(2025)]",
     "Analysing situation of Rural Online Education before Phase lll (August, 2023) of BharatNet Project",
     "The need for online education in India was mainly found during the Covid-19 lockdown period but then millions of students were struggling for proper access to online learning for lack of connections and devices, majorly in rural areas. An article of IndiaToday (2020) claims that while the benefits of online learning are manifold, there are still many roadblocks in the way ahead towards making education an entirely digital (online) phenomenon. After the lockdown period the trend of online education was starting rapidly but simultaneously it was creating some disparities between those who have proper internet connection and digital devices and those who do not . TheWave-1oftheASER (2020)survey also reported that a mere 18.3 percent of children in rural areas enrolled in government schools have accessed video recordings, and 8.1 percent have attended live online classes.",
     "Thus, we can feel that the main two problems are, one is the financial barrier for accessing digital devices and the other is poor internet connection or lack of internet accessibility in many rural regions. Let's see how the BharatNet Phase-lll is creating impact in the second issue for emitting the gap of Digital Divide in Indian Education Sector.",
     "The Impact of BharatNet project in rural online education:-",
     "The BharatNet project makes some very impactful milestones in the field of connecting villages in some regions of our country. According to the EconomicSurveyreport2024-25, as of December 2024, 6.92 lakh km of Optical Fiber Cable (OFC) has been laid, 2.14 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) are service-ready (including 5,032 via satellite, 12.04 lakh Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) connections have been installed. Telecom infrastructure is being strengthened through the Bharat Net Project, extending broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats and villages. [telecomtalk.info (2025)]",
     "There is some data which shows the progress of this project across the all state and union territories of India: Figure 1 and Figure 2 as follows: Source: bbnl.nic.in",
     "Thus the rapid expansion of the broadband services through BharatNet somehow created a better situation for students to access digital services and online learning in those places where internet connection was not available before this project. According to smventure.com (2025), the BharaNet project’s linkage with schemes like PMGDISHA (which has trained over 6.39 crore individuals in digital literacy) and collaboration with NABARD further enhance its socioeconomic value. Through BharatNet, healthcare centers are being digitally enabled, schools are accessing virtual learning content, and local governance is becoming more efficient. As an example we can see that in Gujarat’s Sakarda village (Tapi district), once broadband from BharatNet reached its local Gram Panchayat (in 2022), the primary school with 165 students and seven teachers began using smart boards and online content in classrooms. Students reportedly became much more engaged in watching educational videos, participating in online yoga, and observing cultural performances, reflecting a real shift toward digital learning enabled by internet access as per a report of IndiaToday (2025).",
     "In spite of the implementation of the BharatNet Project, there are still some problems, mainly in some regions of India. All states are not getting the basic advantage by this internet. PujaDash(2025)shows that even by the end of 2023, less than 60% of the gram panchayats in northeastern states were service-ready, while the national average is 79% . “Key challenges (for the BharatNet programme) have been the shifting goalposts, slackening deadlines and lack of coordination with other agencies and entities, especially those who can and should leverage broadband,” said Deepak Maheshwari, Senior Policy Advisor at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP), a public policy think-tank based in New Delhi [indiaspend.com (2025)] . The study of Puja Dash also shows that despite widespread implementation efforts, only about 24% of government schools nationwide had internet access among them most located in urban areas. For instance, in Telangana, only 8.78% of government schools had internet connection as of 2021, severely limiting access to online education . The project has also faced significant delays in implementation, with the pace of progress being slower than anticipated. Despite the government's efforts to connect villages, only about 194,000 out of the targeted 640,000 villages have been connected so far. This slow progress has hindered the project's ability to bridge the Digital Divide in rural areas [DrishtiIAS (2023)]",
     "At the end we can say that obviously it is a very good initiative but it should be more effective which definitely goes one important step ahead to ensuring equal digital access in India ."

    heading: "THEME 2:Online Education Push During COVID-19 Lockdown",
    paragraphs: [
     "When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, life changed overnight. Schools across India shut their gates with no idea when they would open again. One day, students were sitting in classrooms with blackboards and notebooks, the next, they were stuck at home, cut off from their teachers, friends, and any sense of routine. Homes with no internet, no smartphones, and sometimes no electricity became the new ‘classrooms’. Parents struggled to keep up and teachers scrambled to figure out Zoom or WhatsApp classes. The disruption was massive: nearly 320 million learners across India were affected, making it one of the largest educational crises the country had ever seen (NCERT,2021;ResearchGate,2020). In cities, some students switched to Google Meet and online assignments. But in villages and low-income households, the story was very different, one where the digital divide turned into a learning divide.",
     "A Hard Gap: Connectivity and Devices:-",
     "Studies before the pandemic found that only about 4.4% of rural households had a computer, versus 23.4% in urban areas (NSSO,75thRound,2018). Internet access was 14.9% in rural homes compared to 42% in cities (NSSO,75thRound,2018). Operating skills were similarly uneven: just 9-13% of rural residents could use computers or the internet, compared to over 30% in urban settings (MoSPI, 2019). A local survey in Chennai showed only 5.3% of rural government school kids could take live classes(AzimPremjiFoundation,2021).While 56.9% had smartphones, only about 21.1% of private school students could attend online lessons regularly(OxfamIndia,InequalityReport,2021).",
     "Government Initiatives: SWAYAM Prabha and Manodarpan:-",
     "To ensure continuity of education during the lockdown, the government expanded the SWAYAM Prabha network, 32 DTH TV channels that telecast curriculum-based lessons 24x7, allowing students in far-flung areas and those unable to afford smart phones and mobile data to follow through with lessons. In tandem, the government addressed mental health. Launched under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme, Manodarpan allowed students, teachers, and parents to avail free tele-counselling to those feeling overwhelmed and isolated during a particularly gruelling period of stress and isolation. Early figures suggest that lakhs availed of the helpline, highlighting the deep-rooted impact of the pandemic on mental well-being and the need for the simultaneous facilitation of learning and mental wellness(MinistryofEducation,2020).",
     "Impact on Educational Equity:-",
     "What worked:One of the primary benefits during the lockdown was the ability of SWAYAM Prabha to reach students who did not have internet access. By conducting lessons on television, it allowed rural students, including those without smartphones and data, to continue their education. Through the Manodarpan initiative, the government also addressed mental health, providing students the emotional care they needed at a time when stress was heightened. Certain states also capitalized on this opportunity to improve long-term digital infrastructure. Kerala granted internet access to over 80% of gram panchayats, which enabled the establishment of smart classrooms and computer labs across rural government schools. (swayamprabha.gov.in,manodarpan.education.gov.in)",
     "What didn’t: Efforts to make digital education accessible did not yield the desired results. While 14.9% of rural households had access to the internet, only 4-5% of them had a computer. Millions of students in India did not have the means to attend live classes and use online educational portals. Many of the e-learning resources did not have multi-lingual or interactive options. Regional languages were a barrier to learning as most of the internet content was in English. The switch to e-learning was a big disadvantage to girls. Girls had more household chores to attend to, lesser access to smartphones and lesser freedom to use the internet for education. Many teachers could not conduct online classes as most of them had never used the internet before. (swayamprabha.gov.in,manodarpan.education.gov.in).",
     "Data Snapshot: Rural vs Urban Access - Households with computer: Rural 4.4–4.8%, Urban 23.4%. Households with internet: Rural 14.9–16.5%, Urban 42%. People able to use internet: Rural 13%, Urban 37%. (Sources: NSSO75thRound,MinistryofStatistics&MOSPI (2017–18))",
     "Case Example: Rajasthan’s DigiLEP Initiative:-",
     "The state government of Rajasthan launched a Digital Learning Enhancement Programme (DigiLEP) to reach students in state schools. Teachers shared videos, worksheets and quizzes with students and their parents via WhatsApp, covering more than 68,000 schools across the state (UNICEF India, 2021). DigiLEP was able to leverage low-tech approaches to support continuity of learning in contexts with poor internet connectivity. In tribal areas such as Dungarpur and Baran, students accessed learning content using basic phones. However, challenges remained. In households with limited access to phones, boys were offered access more often than girls. There were limited opportunities for two-way communication and interaction between students and teachers, and girls in particular struggled to gain equal access to content. Nevertheless, DigiLEP was able to provide a workable solution. (WorldBank/OEDC2020CaseStudy)",
     "The shift to online learning happened quickly but unevenly. TV channels like SWAYAM Prabha and mental health support through Manodarpan aimed to fill gaps. However, many rural students, particularly girls, missed out. Limited access to the internet, electricity, or devices blocked participation(NSSO,2018).Government programs like BharatNet and PMGDISHA strive to improve digital access, but coverage remains inconsistent(OxfamIndia,2021).Real progress requires proper infrastructure."

    heading: "THEME 3:  PM e-Vidya under New Education Policy 2020 - A Visionary Shift or Digital Exclusion?",
    paragraphs: [
     "The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 implemented ambitious reforms in the Indian education sector, much of which emphasized technology-driven learning. PM e-Vidya, one of the key reforms, aimed to streamline digital education engagement and content in creative ways under the initiative; “One Nation, One Digital Platform” (Ministry of Education, 2020) and to enroll individuals in a digital ecosystem, which included DIKSHA, digital teacher training, SWAYAM, and DTH TV channels. The NEP aspired to equitable and inclusive education, especially in light of the challenges to education posed by COVID-19. However, the reality provides a different view—individuals have been empowered, and disempowered or excluded through this digital push, notably in rural and excluded communities.",
     "Digital Infrastructure versus Digital Reality:-",
     "NEP 2020’s bold drive for EdTech integration is fraught with challenges. While technology promises to deliver flexibility, personalization and new-age pedagogy (UNESCO, 2021), it assumes some level of baseline provision for access to electricity, internet and portable digital devices, although millions of Indian students are still without the basic ability to access them. The NFHS-5 (2022) data shows us that only 15% of rural households in India have internet accessibility, compared to 42% of urban households. The reality of the inequity provides a clear picture of why this is a continuing challenge for achieving SDG 10 – Reduce Inequality (NFHS5,2022).",
     "Graphical Snapshot: Internet Access in Gram Panchayats (2024) - Kerala: 82%, Tamil Nadu: 65%, Uttar Pradesh: 35%, Jharkhand: 31%, Bihar: 28%. (Source: TimesofIndia,May22,2024;BharatNetProgressDashboard(TOI,2024))",
     "As part of my internship with the Rajasthan Legal Services Authority (RLSA), I helped organize awareness camps in schools in remote areas such as rural blocks of Jodhpur district during April 2024, where we focused on promoting legal literacy. Through this experience, I had firsthand contact with the students and teachers, and I observed how lack of access to smartphones, intermittent internet connectivity, and barriers such as language prevented our rural students and teachers from being digitally connected. For example, many of the students had only heard of the DIKSHA portal, and many of the teachers acknowledged that they felt very little confidence interacting with online content primarily due to lack of training.",
     "This data points to extreme inequities in our education system. States like Kerala have been successful in advancing digital infrastructure for example, the KITE VICTERS TV initiative and smart classrooms in rural government schools—to enhance delivery of education (The Hindu, 2023), whereas states like Bihar and Jharkhand are considerably behind. Although PM e-Vidya is a great opportunity, in states like this the gap remains in infrastructure rather than policy (EconomicandPoliticalWeekly,2022).",
     "PM e-Vidya: Missed Opportunities:-",
     "PM e-Vidya, launched as part of the NEP 2020 and COVID response, is a comprehensive multimode access platform that combines digital, TV, radio, and podcasts to reach diverse learners. It was especially vital for families without smartphones and internet (PRSIndia,2022). However, the scheduling, language constraints, and no interactive component lessened their efficacy. According to a CBSETrainingReport (2023), more than 40% of teachers in rural schools were unaware of anything from the digital platforms.",
     "There are some regionallevel variationslikeKerala, with its proactive education system, used KITE VICTERS to show daily lessons, each day on TV in Malayalam (TheHindu,2023). In contrast, in many parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, students were relegated to WhatsApp notes or had no connection at all. These examples show that central policies must allow for localized adaptation (EPW,2022).",
     "One of the more ambitious features of NEP 2020, PM e-Vidya, sought to virtualise education through a common platform that harnessed the powers of TV, radio and online portals. On paper, it was revolutionary. In reality, the experience has been mixed depending on where one lives and their socio-economic bracket.",
     "In Kerala, the KITE VICTERS educational TV channel put under PM e-Vidya was a boon for lakhs of students during the COVID-19 lockdown. The state made sure that daily Malayalam language classes, aired at a prescribed time, were reachable even in regions without smartphones or internet. According to a report by KITE in 2021, more than 3.5 million students accessed television programmes in the peak month of lockdown (KITEKerala,2021).In comparison, states like Jharkhand or Bihar have had impacts from PM e-Vidya that are comparatively weaker and limited. According to a recent study (OxfamIndia,2022), more than 80% of children in low-income rural families in Bihar had no access to either smartphones or educational TV. Many of these families explained that they had to prioritise the phone for earning or telephone calls to relatives, and there simply no educational continuity for the child. Teachers reported confusion regarding the content release schedule and felt they didn't have a role in the platform's launch because they had not received any training.",
     "Even urban slum populations have had limited learning outcomes from PM e-Vidya content. Azim Premji University (2022) reported that even when almost 50% of samples (students living in urban poverty) had access to some kind of digital content, comprehension was extremely low because of the use of language, a lack of engaging interactivity, and very few instances of feedback (AzimPremjiFoundation,2022). That being said, there are islands of success. Teachers in Nagaland began to curate localized content linked to PM e-Vidya TV broadcasts and then via WhatsApp. Volunteers from the community helped distribute worksheets, and students attended community TV viewing spaces that were set up in village halls, and the hybrid model fostered significant reengagement in learning for tribal students. A UNESCOSouthAsiaBriefingfrom2023documented this.",
     "These examples illustrate that PM e-Vidya can be transformational, but only if integrated within localized delivery frameworks, inclusive of language, and with follow-up support on-the-ground. Without these features, the current top-down, one-size-fits-all structure only further embeds preexisting digital and educational inequities."

    heading: "THEME 4: Assessing the Impact of DIKSHA and SWAYAM on Indian Educational Inequalities",
    paragraphs: [
     "Platforms like DIKSHA and SWAYAM have pushed through long-standing barriers to education in India's drive for inclusive education. (TheMinistryofEducation,2020) states that DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing) and SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) are flagship platforms for providing high-quality educational resources at scale. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 clearly frames technology as central to promoting \"access, equity, and quality.\" Especially in the wake of pandemic-induced school closures and longstanding infrastructure gaps, these platforms are expected to ensure continuity and act as strategic reforms that narrow the deep urban-rural, gender, and income gaps, helping to redefine India’s educational landscape.",
     "Launched in 2017, DIKSHA is a national platform for school education, by NCERT, under the aegis of the Ministry of Education (MoE), GoI (DIKSHA,2024) was developed to advance inclusive and equitable education as envisioned in NEP. Based on the EkStep Foundation's opensource Sunbird platform, it facilitates inclusive teaching and foundational learning nationwide by offering multilingual, accessible content from NCERT, CBSE, and SCERTs to over 200 million students and seven million teachers (TheEconomicTimes,2023).",
     "Fig 1- One diksha, multiple central and state solutions and programme Source-IndiaReportDigitalEducation,2020",
     "With the goal to promote inclusivity and reduce access gaps, the DIKSHA app integrates interactive content in a variety of formats and languages, particularly in remote and linguistically diverse areas. More than 72% students and 87% of teachers have signed up for classes on DIKSHA, indicating a strong inclination to use digital tools if given the right support, proving to be a crucial component of digital equity (Vermaetal.,2024). However, only 66.38% of teachers agreed that content loads easily on mobile devices, and 59.66% noted sufficient media variety.",
     "Technological barriers persist in mobile compatibility and content diversity (Roul&Mohalik,2025) Likewise, SWAYAM, India’s MOOC platform, also launched in July 2017, aims to achieve the three cardinal principles of Education Policy: access, equity and quality (Swayam,2025).It hosts courses from class 9 to post-graduation. It gives professors from centrally funded universities like IISERs, IITs, and IIMs the opportunity to teach students. 11,772 courses have been offered by SWAYAM as of July 2025. Over 910,000 students have signed up for proctored exams, and about 650,000 students have received certificates (Wikipedia,2025).",
     "With more than 10 million registered users using adaptable evaluation techniques, SWAYAM helps bridge the gap in digital and educational accessibility by providing customized and scalable learning pathways for a wide range of demographics (Jadhav&Rathod,2024). However, 27.75% of students found the teaching difficult to follow, and roughly 31.28% of students left because the content was only in English. Additionally, about 24.58% of students said that boring video lectures encouraged them to drop out of the course, suggesting that interactive content design could improve engagement, especially for students from underprivileged backgrounds (Singh,2022).",
     "SWAYAM Platform Key Metrics (As of February 2023) - Total Enrolment: 31,000,000; Effective Enrolment: 24,405,178; Exam Registration: 2,629,526; Assignment Submissions: 883,605; Courses Offered: 3,000+; Universities Accepting Credit: 288. (Source-TimesofIndia,2023)",
     "SWAYAM's increasing influence as India's top MOOC platform is shown in the data. It demonstrates high user engagement with over 24.4 million active learners and 31 million total enrollments. Also, credible academic participation is shown by the 2.6 million exam registrations and the 880,000+ assignment submissions, and its integration into formal education is confirmed by the 288 universities that accept credits."

  conclusion: [
   "The study reveals a shift in India's educational scenario due to increase in digital infrastructure. Programs like BharatNet have enabled connectivity even in the remote areas, supporting online education. However, the benefits were not evenly distributed and were different, especially for the marginalized communities. They face difficulties in their access to digital opportunities.",
   "To bridge this gap, policies must not only ensure infrastructural support but also is affordable, accessible, and is structured in a way comfortable to address this concern of digital divide.",
   "In order to address India's historical educational inequalities, platforms such as DIKSHA and SWAYAM have become critical instruments. By providing scalable, multilingual, and accessible digital content, these platforms support the NEP 2020 vision of equitable and inclusive education. DIKSHA has made commendable progress, particularly in enhancing foundational learning and reaching linguistically and geographically diverse learners, as evidenced by high teacher and student interaction.",
   "However, enduring problems like restricted media diversity and mobile compatibility underscore the necessity of additional infrastructure investment and adaptive content creation. On a similar note, SWAYAM's extensive course library, adaptable evaluation, and participation of prestigious universities have increased access across socioeconomic divides.",
   "Improving vernacular content, increasing mobile access, and incorporating adaptive learning analytics for personalized learning are all crucial to filling in the gaps in platforms like SWAYAM and DIKSHA. Prioritizing teacher training in digital pedagogy is essential, particularly in rural areas. Delivery of education will be inclusive, interesting, and contextually relevant if communitybased digital support systems, such as local learning hubs, are established and continuous monitoring and feedback systems are integrated.",
   "DIKSHA and SWAYAM can more successfully close the digital divide and act as global models for inclusive digital education.",
   "For NEP 2020 and PM e-Vidya to truly disrupt systematic inequality, the government must improve rural internet infrastructure, and provide content in regional languages. They must equip educators with EdTech training and enable parental and community involvement in digital learning. This is an excellent way to ensure better access to digital policies and help in reducing education inequality.",
   "We can also introduce digital literacy programmes in rural areas and launch similar programmes in the school, in order to spread awareness and help them to gain a practical exposure so that they understand the importance as well as get comfortable accessing digital opportunities with the use of their digital skills.",
   "In conclusion, digital transformation will boost tremendously if it stands still on its promise for reducing inequality, and ensure every learner has equal access and ability to benefit from the digital tools and opportunities."
